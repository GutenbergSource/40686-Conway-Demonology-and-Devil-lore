<p class="first">&lsquo;We are all nothing other than Wills,&rsquo;
says St. Augustine; and he adds that of the good and bad angels the
nature is the same, the will different. In harmony with this John
Beaumont says, &lsquo;A good desire of mind is a good God.<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e924" title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e926src" href="#xd26e926" name="xd26e926src">1</a> To
which all the mythology of Evil adds, a bad desire of mind is a Devil.
Every personification of an evil Will looks beyond the outward
phenomena of pain, and conceives a heart that loves evil, a spirit that
makes for wickedness. At this point a new element altogether enters.
The physical pain incidentally represented by the Demon, generalised
and organised into a principle of harmfulness in the Dragon, begins now
to pass under the shadow cast by the ascending light of man&rsquo;s
moral nature. Man becomes conscious of moral and spiritual pains: they
may be still imaginatively connected with bodily <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>agonies, but
these drop out of the immediate conception, disappear into a distant
future, and are even replaced by the notion of an evil symbolised by
pleasure.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between either a Demon or Dragon and a
Devil may be recognised in this: we never find the former voluntarily
bestowing physical pleasure or happiness on man, whereas it is a chief
part of the notion of a Devil that he often confers earthly favours in
order to corrupt the moral nature.</p>
<p>There are, indeed, apparent exceptions to this theorem presented in
the agatho-dragons which have already been considered in our chapter on
the Basilisk; but the reader will observe that there is no intimation
in such myths of any malign ulterior purpose in the good omens brought
by those exceptional monsters, and that they are really forms of
malevolent power whose afflictive intent is supposed to have been
vanquished by the superior might of the heroes or saints to whose glory
they are reluctantly compelled to become tributary.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the Dragon attended this moral and religious development
of man&rsquo;s inward nature very far, and still occupies, as at once
prisoner and gaoler in the underworld, a subordinate relation to it. In
the long process he has undergone certain transformations, and in
particular his attribute of wings, if not derived from the notion of
his struggle against holier beings, seems to have been largely enhanced
thereby. The exceptional wings given to serpents in Greek art, those,
for instance, which draw Demeter and Persephone in their chariot, are
trifling as compared with the fully-developed wings of our conventional
Dragon of the christian era. Such wings might have been developed
occasionally to denote the flying cloud, the fire-breathing storm, or
explain how some R&aacute;hu was enabled to pursue the sun and moon and
swallow them temporarily <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3"
name="pb3">3</a>]</span>in the phenomena of eclipse. But these wings
grew to more important dimensions when they were caught up into the
Semitic conception of winged genii and destroying angels, and
associated with an ambitious assault on heaven and its divine or
angelic occupants.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was war in Heaven,&rsquo; says the Apocalypse. The
traditional descriptions of this war follow pretty closely, in dramatic
details, other and more ancient struggles which reflect man&rsquo;s
encounters with the hardships of nature. In those encounters man
imagined the gods descending earthward to mingle in the fray; but even
where the struggle mounted highest the scenery is mainly terrestrial
and the issues those of place and power, the dominion of visible Light
established above Darkness, or of a comparatively civilised over a
savage race. The wars between the Devas and Asuras in India, the Devs
and Ahuras in Persia, Buddha and the Nagas in Ceylon, Gar&uacute;ra and
the Serpent-men in the north of India, gods and Frost-giants in
Scandinavia, still concern man&rsquo;s relation to the fruits of the
earth, to heat and frost, to darkness or storm and sunshine.</p>
<p>But some of these at length find versions which reveal their
tendency towards spiritualisation. The differences presented by one of
these legends which has survived among us in nearly its ancient form
from the same which remains in a partly mystical form will illustrate
the transitional phase. Thus, Gar&uacute;ra expelling the serpents from
his realm in India is not a saintly legend; this exterminator of
serpents is said to have compelled the reptile race to send him one of
their number daily that he might eat it, and the rationalised tradition
interprets this as the prince&rsquo;s cannibalism. The expulsion of
Nagas or serpents from Ceylon by Buddha, in order that he might
consecrate that island to the holy law, marks the pious accentuation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>of the fable. The expulsion of snakes from Ireland
by St. Patrick is a legend conceived in the spirit of the curse
pronounced upon the serpent in Eden, but in this case the modern myth
is the more primitive morally, and more nearly represents the exploit
of Gar&uacute;ra. St. Patrick expels the snakes that he may make
Ireland a paradise physically, and establish his reputation as an
apostle by fulfilling the signs of one named by Christ;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e945src" href="#xd26e945" name="xd26e945src">2</a>
and in this particular it slightly rises above the Hindu story. In the
case of the serpent cursed in Eden a further moralisation of the
conflict is shown. The serpent is not present in Eden, as in the realms
of Gar&uacute;ra and St. Patrick, for purposes of physical devastation
or pain, but to bestow a pleasure on man with a view to success in a
further issue between himself and the deity. Yet in this Eden myth the
ancient combat is not yet fairly spiritualised; for the issue still
relates, as in that between the Devas and Asuras, to the possession of
a magical fruit which by no means confers sanctity. In the apocalyptic
legend of the war in heaven,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e950src" href=
"#xd26e950" name="xd26e950src">3</a> the legend has become fairly
spiritualised. The issue is no longer terrestrial, it is no longer for
mere power; the Dragon is arrayed against the woman and child, and
against the spiritual &lsquo;salvation&rsquo; of mankind, of whom he is
&lsquo;accuser&rsquo; and &lsquo;deceiver.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surely nobody could be &lsquo;deceived&rsquo; by &lsquo;a great
fiery-red Dragon, having seven heads and ten horns&rsquo;! In this
vision the Dragon is pressed as far as the form can go in the
symbolisation of evil. To devour the child is its legitimate work, but
as &lsquo;accuser of the brethren before God day and night&rsquo; the
monstrous shape were surely out of place by any mythologic analogy; and
one could hardly imagine such a physiognomy capable of deceiving
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>&lsquo;the whole world.&rsquo; It is not wonderful,
therefore, that the Dragon&rsquo;s presence in heaven is only mentioned
in connection with his fall from it. It is significant that the wings
are lost in this fall; for while his &lsquo;angelic&rsquo; relationship
suggests the previous wings, the woman is able to escape the fallen
monster by the two wings given her.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e959src"
href="#xd26e959" name="xd26e959src">4</a> Wingless now, &lsquo;the old
serpent&rsquo; once more, the monster&rsquo;s shape has no adaptation
to the moral and religious struggle which is to ensue. For his shape is
a method, and it means the perfection of brute force. That, indeed,
also remains in the sequel of this magnificent myth. As in the legend
of the Hydra two heads spring up in place of that which falls, so in
this Christian legend out of the overthrown monster, henceforth himself
concealed, two arise from his inspiration,&mdash;the seven-headed,
ten-horned Beast who continues the work of wrath and pain; but also a
lamb-like Beast, with only two horns (far less terrible), and able to
deceive by his miracles, for he is even able to call down fire from
heaven. The ancient Serpent-dragon, the expression of natural pain,
thus goes to pieces. His older part remains to work mischief and hurt;
and the cry is uttered, &lsquo;Be merry, ye heavens, and ye that
tabernacle in them: woe to the earth and the sea! for the devil is come
down unto you, having great wrath because he knows that he has a short
time.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e964src" href="#xd26e964" name=
"xd26e964src">5</a> But there is a lamb-like part of him too, and his
relation to the Dragon is only known by his voice.</p>
<p>This subtle adaptation of the symbol of external pain to the
representation of the moral struggle, wherein the hostile power may
assume deceptive forms of beauty and pleasure, is only one impressive
illustration of the transfer of human conceptions of evil from outward
to inward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>nature. The transition is from a malevolent, fatal,
principle of harmfulness to the body to a malevolent, fatal, principle
of evil to the conscience. The Demon was natural; the Dragon was both
physical and metaphysical; the Devil was and is theological. In the
primitive Zoroastrian theology, where the Devil first appears in clear
definition, he is the opponent of the Good Mind, and the combat between
the two, Ormuzd and Ahriman, is the spiritualisation of the combat
between Light and Darkness, Pain and Happiness, in the external world.
As these visible antagonists were supposed to be exactly balanced
against each other, so are their spiritual correlatives. The Two Minds
are described as Twins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those old Spirits, who are twins, made known what is good and
what is evil in thoughts, words, and deeds. Those who are good
distinguished between the two; not so those who are evil-doers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When these two Spirits came together they made first life and
death, so that there should be at last the most wretched life for the
bad, but for the good blessedness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of these two Spirits the evil one chose the worst deeds; the
kind Spirit, he whose garment is the immovable sky, chose what is
right.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e980src" href="#xd26e980" name=
"xd26e980src">6</a></p>
<p>This metaphysical theory follows closely the primitive scientific
observations on which it is based; it is the cold of the cold, the
gloom of the darkness, the sting of death, translated into some order
for the intellect which, having passed through the Dragon, we find
appearing in this Persian Devil; and against his blackness the glory of
the personality from whom all good things proceed shines out in a
splendour no longer marred by association with the evil side of nature.
Ormuzd is celebrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7"
name="pb7">7</a>]</span>as &lsquo;father of the <i>pure</i>
world,&rsquo; who sustains &lsquo;the earth and the clouds that they do
not fall,&rsquo; and &lsquo;has made the <i>kindly</i> light and the
darkness, the kindly sleep and the awaking;&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e993src" href="#xd26e993" name="xd26e993src">7</a> at every
step being suggested the father of the <i>impure</i> world, the
<i>unkindly</i> light, darkness or sleep.</p>
<p>The ecstasy which attended man&rsquo;s first vision of an ideal life
defied the contradictory facts of outward and inward nature. So soon as
he had beheld a purer image of himself rising above his own animalism,
he must not only regard that animalism as an instigation of a devil,
but also the like of it in nature; and this conception will proceed
<i lang="la">pari passu</i> with the creation of pure deities in the
image of that higher self. There was as yet no philosophy demanding
unity in the Cosmos, or forbidding man to hold as accursed so much of
nature as did not obviously accord with his ideals.</p>
<p>Mr. Edward B. Tylor has traced the growth of Animism from
man&rsquo;s shadow and his breathing; Sir John Lubbock has traced the
influence of dreams in forming around him a ghostly world; Mr. Herbert
Spencer has given an analysis of the probable processes by which this
invisible environment was shaped for the mental conception in
accordance with family and social conditions. But it is necessary that
we should here recognise the shadow that walked by the moral nature,
the breathings of religious aspiration, and the dreams which visited a
man whose moral sense was so generally at variance with his animal
desires. The code established for the common good, while necessarily
having a relation to every individual conscience, is a restriction upon
individual liberty. The conflict between selfishness and duty is thus
inaugurated; it continues in the struggle between the &lsquo;law in the
members <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>and the law in the spirit,&rsquo; which led Paul to
beat his body (<span class="trans" title="hypopiaxomai"><span class=
"Greek" lang=
"grc">&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&pi;&iota;&alpha;&xi;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&#8055;</span></span>)
to keep it in subjection; it passes from the Latin poet to the
Englishman, who turns his experience to a rune&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I see the right, and I approve it too;</p>
<p class="line">Condemn the wrong, and yet the wrong pursue.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">As the light which cast it was intense, even so
intense was the shadow it cast beneath all it could not penetrate.
Passionate as was the saintliest man&rsquo;s love of good, even so
passionate was his spiritual enemy&rsquo;s love of evil. High as was
the azure vault that mingled with his dreams of purity, so deep was the
abyss beneath his lower nature. The superficial equalities of
phenomena, painful and pleasurable, to his animal nature had cast the
mould into which his theories of the inward and the moral phenomena
must be cast; and thus man&mdash;in an august moment&mdash;surrendered
himself to the dreadful conception of a supreme Principle of
Wickedness: wherever good was there stood its adversary; wherever
truth, there its denier; no light shone without the dark presence that
would quench it; innocence had its official accuser, virtue its
accomplished tempter, peace its breaker, faith its disturber and
mocker. Nay, to this impersonation was added the last feature of
fiendishness, a nature which found its supreme satisfaction in
ultimately torturing human beings for the sins instigated by
himself.</p>
<p>It is open to question how far any average of mankind really
conceived this theological dogma. Easy as it is to put into clear
verbal statement; readily as the analogies of nature supply arguments
for and illustrations of a balance between moral light and darkness,
love and hatred; yet is man limited in subjective conceptions to his
own possibilities, and it may almost be said that to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>genuinely
believe in an absolute Fiend a man would have to be potentially one
himself. But any human being, animated by causeless and purposeless
desire to inflict pain on others, would be universally regarded as
insane, much more one who would without motive corrupt as well as
afflict.</p>
<p>Even theological statements of the personality of Evil, and what
that implies, are rare. The following is brave enough to be put on
record, apart from its suggestiveness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be denied that as there is an inspiration of holy
love, so is there an inspiration of hatred, or frantic pleasure, with
which men surrender themselves to the impulses of destructiveness; and
when the popular language speaks of possessions of Satan, of incarnate
devils, there lies at the bottom of this the grave truth that men, by
continued sinning, may pass the ordinary limit between human and
diabolic depravity, and lay open in themselves a deep abyss of hatred
which, without any mixture of self-interest, finds its gratification in
devastation and woe.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1035src" href=
"#xd26e1035" name="xd26e1035src">8</a></p>
<p>On this it may be said that the popular commentary on cases of the
kind is contained in the very phrase alluded to,
&lsquo;possession,&rsquo;&mdash;the implication being that such
disinterested depravity is nowise possible within the range of simple
human experience,&mdash;and, in modern times, &lsquo;possessions&rsquo;
are treated in asylums. Morbid conditions, however, are of such varied
degrees that it is probable many have imagined a Being in whom their
worst impulses are unrestrained, and thus there have been sufficient
popular approximations to an imaginative conception of a Devil to
enable the theological dogma, which few can analyse, to survive.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the moral and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>spiritual ideals, to which allusion has just been
made, are normally represented in the various Devils which we have to
consider. It is the characteristic of personifications, whether
celestial or infernal, to supersede gradually the ideas out of which
they spring. As in the fable of Agni, who is said to have devoured his
parents when he was born, a metaphor of fire consuming the two sticks
which produce it, religious history shows both deities and devils, by
the flame of personal devotion or hatred they engender, burning up the
ideas that originate them. When instead of unconscious forces and
inanimate laws working to results called good and evil, men see great
personal Wills engaged in personal conflict, the universe becomes a
government of combat; the stars of heaven, the angels and the imps, men
and women, the very plants and animals, are caught up in the battle, to
be marshalled on one side or the other; and in the military spirit and
fury of the struggle the spiritual ideals become as insignificant
beneath the phantom-hosts they evoked as the violets and daisies which
an army tramples in its march. There is little difference at last
between the moral characteristics of the respective armies of Ormuzd
and Ahriman, Michael and Satan; their strategy and ferocity are the
same.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1048src" href="#xd26e1048" name=
"xd26e1048src">9</a> Wherever the conception is that of a universe
divided into hostile camps, the appropriate passions are kindled, and
in the thick of the field, where Cruelty and Gentleness met, is seen at
last a horned Beast confronted by a horned Lamb.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1051src" href="#xd26e1051" name="xd26e1051src">10</a> On both
sides is exaltation of the horn. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11"
href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>We need only look at the outcome of the gentle and lowly Jesus
through the exigencies of the church militant to see how potent are
such forces. Although lay Christians of ordinary education are
accustomed to rationalise their dogmas as well as they can, and dwell
on the loving and patient characteristics of Jesus, the horns which
were attached to the brow of him who said, &lsquo;Love your
enemies&rsquo; by ages of Christian warfare remain still in the Christ
of Theology, and they are still depended on to overawe the
&lsquo;sinner.&rsquo; In an orthodox family with which I have had some
acquaintance, a little boy, who had used naughty expressions of
resentment towards a playmate was admonished that he should be more
like Christ, &lsquo;who never did any harm to his enemies.&rsquo;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered the wrathful child, &lsquo;but he&rsquo;s
a-going to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As in Demonology we trace the struggles of man with external
obstructions, and the phantasms in which these were reflected until
they were understood or surmounted, we have now to consider the forms
which report human progression on a higher plane,&mdash;that of social,
moral, and religious evolution. Creations of a crude Theology, in its
attempt to interpret the moral sentiment, the Devils to which we now
turn our attention have multiplied as the various interests of mankind
have come into relations with their conscience. Every degree of ascent
of the moral nature has been marked by innumerable new shadows cast
athwart the mind and the life of man. Every new heaven of ideas is
followed by a new earth, but ere this conformity of things to thoughts
can take place struggles must come and the old demons will be recalled
for new service. As time goes on things new grow old; the fresh issues
pass away, their battlefields grow cold; then the brood of superstition
must flit away to the next field where carrion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>is
found. Foul and repulsive as are these vultures of the
mind&mdash;organisms of moral sewage&mdash;every one of them is a
witness to the victories of mankind over the evils they shadow, and to
the steady advance of a new earth which supplies them no habitat but
the arch&aelig;ologist&rsquo;s page. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">The Second Best.</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first">Respect for the Devil&mdash;Primitive
atheism&mdash;Idealisation&mdash;Birth of new gods&mdash;New gods
diabolised&mdash;Compromise between new gods and old&mdash;Foreign
deities degraded&mdash;Their utilisation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A lady residing in Hampshire, England, recently said
to a friend of the present writer, both being mothers, &lsquo;Do you
make your children bow their heads whenever they mention the
Devil&rsquo;s name? I do,&rsquo; she added solemnly,&mdash;&lsquo;I
think it&rsquo;s safer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This instance of reverence for the Devil&rsquo;s name, occurring in
a respectable English family, may excite a smile; but if my reader has
perused the third and fourth chapters (Part I.) of this work, in which
it was necessary to state certain facts and principles which underlie
the phenomena of degradation in both Demonology and Devil-lore, he will
already know the high significance of nearly all the names which have
invested the personifications of evil; and he will not be surprised to
find their original sanctity, though lowered, sometimes, surviving in
such imaginary forms after the battles in which they were vanquished
have passed out of all contemporary interest. If, for example, instead
of the Devil, whose name is uttered with respect in the Hampshire
household, any theological bogey of our own time were there mentioned,
such as &lsquo;Atheist,&rsquo; it might hardly receive such considerate
treatment.</p>
<p>The two chapters just referred to anticipate much that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>should
be considered at this point of our inquiry. It is only necessary here
to supplement them with a brief statement, and to some extent a
recapitulation, of the processes by which degraded deities are
preserved to continue through a structural development and fulfil a
necessary part in every theological scheme which includes the
conception of an eternal difference between good and evil.</p>
<p>Every personification when it first appears expresses a higher and
larger view. When deities representing the physical needs of mankind
have failed, as they necessarily must, to meet those needs, atheism
follows, though it cannot for a long time find philosophical
expression. It is an atheism <i>ad hoc</i>, so to say, and works by
degrading particular gods instead of by constructing antitheistic
theories. Successive dynasties of deities arise and flourish in this
way, each representing a less arbitrary relation to nature,&mdash;peril
lying in that direction,&mdash;and a higher moral and spiritual ideal,
this being the stronghold of deities. It is obvious that it is far
easier to maintain the theory that prayers are heard and answered by a
deity if those prayers are limited to spiritual requests, than when
they are petitions for outward benefits. By giving over the cruel and
remorseless forces of nature to the Devil,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to this
or that personification of them who, as gods, had been appealed to in
vain to soften such forces,&mdash;the more spiritual god that follows
gains in security as well as beauty what he surrenders of empire and
omnipotence. This law, illustrated in our chapter on Fate, operates
with tremendous effect upon the conditions under which the old combat
is spiritualised.</p>
<p>An eloquent preacher has said:&mdash;&lsquo;Hawthorne&rsquo;s fine
fancy of the youth who ascribed heroic qualities to the stone face on
the brow of a cliff, thus converting the rocky profile into a man, and,
by dint of meditating on it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>with admiring awe, actually
transferred to himself the moral elements he worshipped, has been made
fact a thousand times, is made fact every day, by earnest spirits who
by faithful longing turn their visions into verities, and obtain live
answers to their petitions to shadows.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1097src" href="#xd26e1097" name="xd26e1097src">1</a></p>
<p>However imaginary may be the benedictions so derived by the
worshipper from his image, they are most real as they redound to the
glory and power of the image. The crudest personification, gathering up
the sanctities of generations, associated with the holiest hopes, the
best emotions, the profoundest aspirations of human nature, may be at
length so identified with these sentiments that they all seem
absolutely dependent upon the image they invest. Every criticism of
such a personification then seems like a blow aimed at the moral laws.
If educated men are still found in Christendom discussing whether
morality can survive the overthrow of such personifications, and
whether life were worth living without them, we may readily understand
how in times when the social, ethical, and psychological sciences did
not exist at all, all that human beings valued seemed destined to stand
or fall with the Person supposed to be their only keystone.</p>
<p>But no Personage, however highly throned, can arrest the sun and
moon, or the mind and life of humanity. With every advance in physical
or social conditions moral elements must be influenced; every new
combination involves a recast of experiences, and presently of
convictions. Henceforth the deified image can only remain as a tyrant
over the heart and brain which have created it,&mdash;</p>
<div lang="it" class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e1105">Creatura a un tempo</p>
<p class="line">E tiranno de l&rsquo;uom, da cui soltanto</p>
<p class="line">Ebbe nomi ed aspetti e regno e altari.<a class=

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>This personification, thus &lsquo;at once man&rsquo;s creature and
his tyrant,&rsquo; is objectively a name. But as it has been invested
with all that has been most sacred, it is inevitable that any name
raised against it shall be equally associated with all that has been
considered basest. This also must be personified, for the same reason
that the good is personified; and as names are chiefly hereditary, it
pretty generally happens that the title of some fallen and discredited
deity is advanced to receive the new anathema. But what else does he
receive? The new ideas; the growing ideals and the fresh enthusiasms
are associated with some fantastic shape with anathematised name evoked
from the past, and thus a portentous situation is reached. The
worshippers of the new image will not accept the bad name and its base
associations; they even grow strong enough to claim the name and altars
of the existing order, and give battle for the same. Then occurs the
demoralisation, literally speaking, of the older theology. The
personification reduced to struggle for its existence can no longer lay
emphasis upon the moral principles it had embodied, these being equally
possessed by their opponents; nay, its partisans manage to associate
with their holy Name so much bigotry and cruelty that the innovators
are at length willing to resign it. The personal loyalty, which is
found to continue after loyalty to principles has ceased, proceeds to
degrade the virtues once reverenced when they are found connected with
a rival name. &lsquo;He casteth out devils through Beelzebub&rsquo; is
a very ancient cry. It was heard again when Tertullian said,
&lsquo;Satan is God&rsquo;s ape.&rsquo; St. Augustine recognises the
similarity between the observances of Christians and pagans as proving
the subtle imitativeness of the Devil; the phenomena referred to are
considered elsewhere, but, in the present connection, it may be
remarked that this readiness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>to regard the same sacrament as
supremely holy or supremely diabolical as it is celebrated in honour of
one name or another, accords closely with the reverence or detestation
of things more important than sacraments, as they are, or are not,
consecrated by what each theology deems official sanction. When sects
talk of &lsquo;mere morality&rsquo; we may recognise in the phrase the
last faint war-cry of a god from whom the spiritual ideal has passed
away, and whose name even can survive only through alliance with the
new claimant of his altars. While the new gods were being called devils
the old ones were becoming such.</p>
<p>The victory of the new ideal turns the old one to an idol. But we
are considering a phase of the world when superstition must invest the
new as well as the old, though in a weaker degree. A new religious
system prevails chiefly through its moral superiority to that it
supersedes; but when it has succeeded to the temples and altars
consecrated to previous divinities, when the ardour of battle is over
and conciliation becomes a policy as well as a virtue, the old idol is
likely to be treated with respect, and may not impossibly be brought
into friendly relation with its victorious adversary. He may take his
place as &lsquo;the second best,&rsquo; to borrow Goethe&rsquo;s
phrase, and be assigned some function in the new theologic
r&eacute;gime. Thus, behind the simplicity of the Hampshire lady
instructing her children to bow at mention of the Devil&rsquo;s name,
stretch the centuries in which Christian divines have as warmly
defended the existence of Satan as that of God himself. With sufficient
reason: that infernal being, some time God&rsquo;s &lsquo;ape&rsquo;
and rival, was necessarily developed into his present position and
office of agent and executioner under the divine government. He is the
great Second Best; and it is a strange hallucination to fancy that, in
an age of peaceful inquiry, any divine personification can be
maintained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>without this patient Goat, who bears blame for all
the faults of nature, and who relieves divine Love from the odium of
supplying that fear which is the mother of devotion,&mdash;at least in
the many millions of illogical eyes into which priests can still look
without laughing.</p>
<p>Such, in brief outline, has been the interaction of moral and
intellectual forces operating within the limits of established systems,
and of the nations governed by them. But there are added factors,
intensifying the forces on each side, when alien are brought into
rivalry and collision with national deities. In such a contest, besides
the moral and spiritual sentiments and the household sanctities, which
have become intertwined with the internal deities, national pride is
also enlisted, and patriotism. But on the other side is enlisted the
charm of novelty, and the consciousness of fault and failure in the
home system. Every system imported to a foreign land leaves behind its
practical shortcomings, puts its best foot forward&mdash;namely, its
theoretical foot&mdash;and has the advantage of suggesting a way of
escape from the existing routine which has become oppressive. Napoleon
I. said that no people profoundly attached to the institutions of their
country can be conquered; but what people are attached to the priestly
system over them? That internal dissatisfaction which, in secular
government, gives welcome to a dashing Corsican or a Prince of Orange,
has been the means of introducing many an alien religion, and giving to
many a prophet the honour denied him in his own country. Buddha was a
Hindu, but the triumph of his religion is not in India; Zoroaster was a
Persian, but there are no Parsees in Persia; Christianity is hardly a
colonist even in the native land of Christ.</p>
<p>These combinations and changes were not effected without fierce
controversies, ferocious wars, or persecutions, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>and the
formation of many devils. Nothing is more normal in ancient systems
than the belief that the gods of other nations are devils. The
slaughter of the priests of Baal corresponds with the development of
their god into Beelzebub. In proportion to the success of Olaf in
crushing the worshippers of Odin, their deity is steadily transformed
to a diabolical Wild Huntsman. But here also the forces of partial
recovery, which we have seen operating in the outcome of internal
reform, manifest themselves; the vanquished, and for a time outlawed
deity, is, in many cases, subsequently conciliated and given an
inferior, and, though hateful, a useful office in the new order.
Sometimes, indeed, as in the case of the Hindu destroyer Siva, it is
found necessary to assign a god, anathematised beyond all power of
whitewash, to an equal rank with the most virtuous deity. Political
forces and the exigencies of propagandism work many marvels of this
kind, which will meet us in the further stages of our
investigation.</p>
<p>Every superseded god who survives in subordination to another is
pretty sure to be developed into a Devil. Euphemism may tell pleasant
fables about him, priestcraft may find it useful to perpetuate belief
in his existence, but all the evils of the universe, which it is
inconvenient to explain, are gradually laid upon him, and sink him
down, until nothing is left of his former glory but a shining name.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Any one who has witnessed Mr. Henry Irving&rsquo;s
scholarly and masterly impersonation of the character of Louis XI. has
had an opportunity of recognising a phase of superstition which happily
it were now difficult to find off the stage. Nothing could exceed the
fine realism with which that artist brought before the spectator the
perfected type of a pretended religion from which all moral features
have been eliminated by such slow processes that the final success is
unconsciously reached, and the horrible result appears unchecked by
even any affectation of actual virtue. We see the king at sound of a
bell pausing in his instructions for a treacherous assassination to
mumble his prayers, and then instantly reverting to the villany over
whose prospective success he gloats. In the secrecy of his chamber no
mask falls, for there is no mask; the face of superstition and vice on
which we look is the real face which the ages of fanaticism have
transmitted to him.</p>
<p>Such a face has oftener been that of a nation than that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>of an
individual, for the healthy forces of life work amid the homes and
hearts of mankind long before their theories are reached and
influenced. Such a face it was against which the moral insurrection
which bears the name of Zoroaster arose, seeing it as physiognomy of
the Evil Mind, naming it Ahriman, and, in the name of the conscience,
aiming at it the blow which is still felt across the centuries.</p>
<p>Ingenious theorists have accounted for the Iranian philosophy of a
universal war between Ormuzd (Ahuramazda) the Good, and Ahriman
(Angromainyus) the Evil, by vast and terrible climatic changes,
involving extremes of heat and cold, of which geologists find traces
about Old Iran, from which a colony of Aryans migrated to New Iran, or
Persia. But although physical conditions of this character may have
supplied many of the metaphors in which the conflict between Good and
Evil is described in the Avesta, there are other characteristics of
that ancient scripture which render it more probable that the early
colonisation of Persia was, like that of New England, the result of a
religious struggle. Some of the gods most adored in India reappear as
execrated demons in the religion of Zoroaster; the Hindu word for god
is the Pars&icirc; word for devil. These antagonisms are not merely
verbal; they are accompanied in the Avesta with the most furious
denunciations of theological opponents, whom it is not difficult to
identify with the priests and adherents of the Brahman religion.</p>
<p>The spirit of the early scriptures of India leaves no room for doubt
as to the point at which this revolution began. It was against pious
Privilege. The saintly hierarchy of India were a caste quite
irresponsible to moral laws. The ancient gods, vague names for the
powers of nature, were strictly limited in their dispensations to those
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>of their priests;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1154src" href="#xd26e1154" name="xd26e1154src">1</a> and as to
these priests the chief necessities were ample offerings, sacrifices,
and fulfilment of the ceremonial ordinances in which their authority
was organised, these were the performances rewarded by a reciprocal
recognition of authority. To the image of this political r&eacute;gime,
theology, always facile, accommodated the regulations of the gods. The
moral law can only live by being supreme; and as it was not supreme in
the Hindu pantheon, it died out of it. The doctrine of
&lsquo;merits,&rsquo; invented by priests purely for their own power,
included nothing meritorious, humanly considered; the merits consisted
of costly sacrifices, rich offerings to temples, tremendous penances
for fictitious sins, ingeniously devised to aggrandise the penances
which disguised power, and prolonged austerities that might be
comfortably commuted by the wealthy. When this doctrine had obtained
general adherence, and was represented by a terrestrial government
corresponding to it, the gods were necessarily subject to it. That were
only to say that the powers of nature were obedient to the
&lsquo;merits&rsquo; of privileged saints; and from this it is an
obvious inference that they are relieved from moral laws binding on the
vulgar.</p>
<p>The legends which represent this phase of priestly dominion are
curiously mixed. It would appear that under the doctrine of
&lsquo;merits&rsquo; the old gods declined. Such appears to be the
intimation of the stories which report the distress of the gods through
the power of human saints. The Rajah Ravana acquired such power that he
was said to have arrested the sun and moon, and so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>oppressed the gods that they temporarily
transformed themselves to monkeys in order to destroy him. Though
Visw&aacute;mitra murders a saint, his merits are such that the gods
are in great alarm lest they become his menials; and the completeness,
with which moral considerations are left out of the struggle on both
sides is disclosed in the item that the gods commissioned a nymph to
seduce the saintly murderer, and so reduce a little the force of his
austerities. It will be remembered that the ancient struggle of the
Devas and Asuras was not owing to any moral differences, but to an
alleged unfair distribution of the ambrosia produced by their joint
labours in churning the ocean. The fact that the gods cheated the
demons on that occasion was never supposed to affect the supremacy they
acquired by the treachery; and it could, therefore, cause no scandal
when later legends reported that the demons were occasionally able to
take gods captive by the practice of these wonderful
&lsquo;merits&rsquo; which were so independent of morals. One Asura is
said to have gained such power in this way that he subjugated the gods,
and so punished them that Siva, who had originally endowed that demon,
called into being Scanda, a war-god, to defend the tortured deities.
The most ludicrous part of all is that the gods themselves were
gradually reduced to the necessity of competing like others for these
tremendous powers; thus the Bhagavat Purana states that Brahma was
enabled to create the universe by previously undergoing penance for
sixteen thousand years.</p>
<p>The legends just referred to are puranic, and consequently of much
later date than the revolution traceable in the Iranian religion; but
these later legends are normal growths from vedic roots. These were the
principles of ancient theology, and the foundation of priestly
government. In view of them we need not wonder that Hindu <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>theology
devised no special devil; almost any of its gods might answer the
purposes of one. Nor need we be surprised that it had no particular
hell; any society organised by the sanctions of religion, but
irresponsible to its moral laws, would render it unnecessary to look
far for a hell.</p>
<p>From this cosmological chaos the more intelligent Hindus were of
course liberated; but the degree to which the fearful training had
corrupted the moral tissues of those who had been subjected to it was
revealed in the bald principle of their philosophers, that the
superstition must continue to be imposed on the vulgar, whilst the
learned might turn all the gods into a scientific terminology.</p>
<p>The first clear and truthful eye that touched that system would
transform it from a Heaven to an Inferno. So was it changed under the
eye of Zoroaster. That ancient pantheon which had become a refuge for
all the lies of the known world; whose gods were liars and their
supporters liars; was now turned into a realm of organised disorder, of
systematised wrong; a vast creation of wickedness, at whose centre sat
its creator and inspirer, the immoral god, the divine
devil&mdash;Ahriman.</p>
<p>It is indeed impossible to ascertain how far the revolt against the
old Brahmanic system was political. It is, of course, highly improbable
that any merely speculative system would excite a revolution; but at
the same time it must be remembered that, in early days, an importance
was generally attached to even abstract opinions such as we still find
among the superstitious who regard an atheistic sentiment as worse than
a theft. However this may have been, the Avesta does not leave us in
any doubt as to the main fact,&mdash;namely, that at a certain time and
place man came to a point where he had to confront antagonism to
fundamental moral principles, and that he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>found the so-called gods
against him. In the establishment of those principles priests
recognised their own disestablishment. What those moral laws that had
become necessary to society were is also made clear. &lsquo;We worship
the Pure, the Lord of Purity!&rsquo; &lsquo;We honour the good spirit,
the good kingdom, the good law,&mdash;all that is good.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Evil doctrine shall not again destroy the world.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Good is the thought, good the word, good the deed, of the pure
Zarathustra.&rsquo; &lsquo;In the beginning the two heavenly Ones
spoke&mdash;the Good to the Evil&mdash;thus: Our souls, doctrines,
words, works, do not unite together.&rsquo; These sentences are from
the oldest G&acirc;th&acirc;s of the Avesta.</p>
<p>The following is a very ancient G&acirc;th&acirc;:&mdash;&lsquo;All
your Devas (Hindu &lsquo;gods&rsquo;) are only manifold children of the
Evil Mind, and the great One who worships the Saoma of lies and
deceits; besides the treacherous acts for which you are notorious in
the Seven Regions of the earth. You have invented all the evil that men
speak and do, which is indeed pleasant to the Devas, and is devoid of
all goodness, and therefore perishes before the insight of the truth of
the wise. Thus you defraud men of their good minds and of their
immortality by your evil minds&mdash;as well by those of the Devas as
through that of the Evil Spirit&mdash;through evil deeds and evil
words, whereby the power of liars grows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;1. Come near, and listen to the wise sayings of the
omniscient, the songs in praise of the Living One, and the prayers of
the Good Spirit, the glorious truths whose origin is seen in the
flames.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2. Listen, therefore, to the Earth spirit&mdash;Look at the
flames with reverent mind. Every one, man and woman, is to be
distinguished according to his belief. Ye ancient Powers, watch and be
with us!</p>
<p>&lsquo;3. From the beginning there were two Spirits, each
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>active in itself. They are the good and the bad in
thought, word, and deed. Choose ye between them: do good, not evil!</p>
<p>&lsquo;4. And these two Spirits meet and create the first existence,
the earthy, that which is and that which is not, and the last, the
spiritual. The worst existence is for the liars, the best for the
truthful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;5. Of these two spirits choose ye one, either the lying, the
worker of Evil, or the true holiest spirit. Whoso chooses the first
chooses the hardest fate; whoso the last, honours Ahuramazda in faith
and in truth by his deeds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;6. Ye cannot serve both of these two. An evil spirit whom we
will destroy surprises those who deliberate, saying, Choose the Evil
Mind! Then do those spirits gather in troops to attack the two lives of
which the prophets prophesy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;7. And to this earthly life came Armaiti with earthly power
to help the truth, and the good disposition: she, the Eternal, created
the material world, but the Spirit is with thee, O Wise One! the first
of creations in time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;8. When any evil falls upon the spirit, thou, O Wise One,
givest temporal possessions and a good disposition; but him whose
promises are lies, and not truth, thou punishest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Around the hymns of the Avesta gradually grew a theology and a
mythology which were destined to exert a powerful influence on the
world. These are contained in the Bundehesch.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1211src" href="#xd26e1211" name="xd26e1211src">2</a> Anterior to
all things and all beings was Zeruane-Akrene (&lsquo;Boundless
Time&rsquo;), so exalted that he can only be worshipped in silence.
From him emanated two Ferouers, spiritual types, which took form in two
beings, Ormuzd and Ahriman. These were equally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>pure;
but Ahriman became jealous of his first-born brother, Ormuzd. To punish
Ahriman for his evil feeling, the Supreme Being condemned him to 12,000
years&rsquo; imprisonment in an empire of rayless Darkness. During that
period must rage the conflict between Light and Darkness, Good and
Evil. As Ormuzd had his pre-existing type or Ferouer, so by a similar
power&mdash;much the same as the Platonic Logos or Word&mdash;he
created the pure or spiritual world, by means of which the empire of
Ahriman should be overthrown. On the earth (still spiritual) he raised
the exceeding high mountain Albordj, Elburz (snow mountain),<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1216src" href="#xd26e1216" name="xd26e1216src">3</a>
on whose summit he fixed his throne; whence he stretched the bridge
Chinevat, which, passing directly over Duzhak, the abyss of Ahriman (or
hell), reaches to the portal of Gorodman, or heaven. All this was but a
Ferouer world&mdash;a prototype of the material world. In anticipation
of its incorporation in a material creation, Ormuzd (by emanations)
created in his own image six Amshaspands, or agents, of both sexes, to
be models of perfection to lower spirits&mdash;and to mankind, when
they should be created&mdash;and offer up their prayers to himself. The
second series of emanations were the Izeds, benevolent genii and
guardians of the world, twenty-eight in number, of whom the chief is
Mithras, the Mediator. The third series of emanations were the
innumerable Ferouers of things and men&mdash;for each must have its
<i>soul</i>, which shall purify them in the day of resurrection. In
antagonism to all these, Ahriman produced an exactly similar host of
dark and evil powers. These Devas rise, rank on rank, to their
Arch-Devs&mdash;each of whom is chained to his planet&mdash;and their
head is Ash-Mogh, the &lsquo;two-footed serpent of lies,&rsquo; who
seems to correspond to Mithras, the divine Mediator. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p>After a reign of 3000 years Ormuzd entered on the work of realising
his spiritual emanations in a material universe. He formed the sun as
commander-in-chief, the moon as his lieutenant, the planets as captains
of a great host&mdash;the stars&mdash;who were soldiers in his war
against Ahriman. The dog Sirius he set to watch at the bridge Chinevat
(the Milky Way), lest thereby Ahriman should scale the heavens. Ormuzd
then created earth and water, which Ahriman did not try to prevent,
knowing that darkness was inherent in these. But he struck a blow when
life was produced. This was in form of a Bull, and Ahriman entered it
and it perished; but on its destruction there came out of its left
shoulder the seed of all clean and gentle animals, and, out of its
right shoulder&mdash;Man.</p>
<p>Ahriman had matched every creation thus far; but to make man was
beyond his power, and he had no recourse but to destroy him. However,
when the original man was destroyed, there sprang from his body a tree
which bore the first human pair, whom Ahriman, however, corrupted in
the manner elsewhere described.</p>
<p>It is a very notable characteristic of this Iranian theology, that
although the forces of good and evil are co-extensive and formally
balanced, in potency they are not quite equal. The balance of force is
just a little on the side of the Good Spirit. And this advantage
appears in man. Zoroaster said, &lsquo;No earthly man with a
hundredfold strength does so much evil as Mithra with heavenly strength
does good;&rsquo; and this thought reappears in the Pars&icirc; belief
that the one part of paradisiac purity, which man retained after his
fall, balances the ninety-nine parts won by Ahriman, and in the end
will redeem him. For this one divine ray preserved enables him to
receive and obey the Avesta, and to climb to heaven by the stairway of
three vast steps&mdash;pure thought, pure word, pure deed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>The
optimistic essence of the mythology is further shown in the belief that
every destructive effort of Ahriman resulted in a larger benefit than
Ormuzd had created. The Bull (Life) destroyed, man and animal sprang
into being; the man destroyed, man and woman appeared. And so on to the
end. In the last quarter of the 12,000 years for which Ahriman was
condemned, he rises to greater power even than Ormuzd, and finally he
will, by a fiery comet, set the visible universe in conflagration; but
while this scheme is waxing to consummation Ormuzd will send his holy
Prophet Sosioch, who will convert mankind to the true law,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1235src" href="#xd26e1235" name="xd26e1235src">4</a>
so that when Ahriman&rsquo;s comet consumes the earth he will really be
purifying it. Through the vast stream of melted metals and minerals the
righteous shall pass, and to them it will be as a bath of warm milk:
the wicked in attempting to pass shall be swept into the abyss of
Duzhak; having then suffered three days and nights, they shall be
raised by Ormuzd refined and purified. Duzhak itself shall be purified
by this fire, and last of all Ahriman himself shall ascend to his
original purity and happiness. Then from the ashes of the former world
shall bloom a paradise that shall remain for ever.</p>
<p>In this system it is notable that we find the monster serpent of
vedic mythology, Ahi, transformed into an infernal region, Duzhak. The
dragon, being a type of physical suffering, passes away in Iranian as
in the later Semitic mythology before the new form, which represents
the stings of conscience though it may be beneath external pleasure. In
this respect, therefore, Ahriman fulfils the definition of a devil
already given. In the Avesta he fulfils also another condition
essential to a devil, the love of evil in and for itself. But in the
later theology it will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"
name="pb30">30</a>]</span>be observed that evil in Ahriman is not
organic. The war being over and its fury past, the hostile chief is
seen not so black as he had been painted; the belief obtains that he
does not actually love darkness and evil. He was thrust into them as a
punishment for his jealousy, pride, and destructive ambition. And
because that dark kingdom was a punishment&mdash;therefore not
congenial&mdash;it was at length (the danger past) held to be
disciplinary. Growing faith in the real supremacy of Good discovers the
immoral god to be an exaggerated anthropomorphic egoist; this divine
devil is a self-centred potentate who had attempted to subordinate
moral law and human welfare to his personal ascendancy. His fate having
sealed the sentence on all ambitions of that character, humanity is
able to pardon the individual offender, and find a hope that Ahriman,
having learned that no real satisfaction for a divine nature can be
found in mere power detached from rectitude, will join in the harmony
of love and loyalty at last. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=

<div class="argument">
<p class="first">Priestcraft and Pessimism&mdash;An Aryan Tetzel and
his Luther&mdash;Brahman Frogs&mdash;Evolution of the sacerdotal
Saint&mdash;Visw&aacute;mitra the Accuser of Virtue&mdash;The Tamil
Passion-play &lsquo;Hari&#347;chandra&rsquo;&mdash;Ordeal of
Goblins&mdash;The Martyr of Truth&mdash;Virtue triumphant over
ceremonial &lsquo;merits&rsquo;&mdash;Hari&#347;chandra and Job.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Priestcraft in government means pessimism in the creed
and despair in the heart. Under sacerdotal rule in India it seemed
paradise enough to leave the world, and the only hell dreaded was a
return to it. &lsquo;The twice-born man,&rsquo; says Manu, &lsquo;who
shall without intermission have passed the time of his studentship,
shall ascend after death to the most exalted of regions, and no more
spring to birth again in this lower world.&rsquo; Some clause was
necessary to keep the twice-born man from suicide. Buddha invented a
plan of suicide-in-life combined with annihilation of the gods, which
was driven out of India because it put into the minds of the people the
philosophy of the schools. Thought could only be trusted among classes
interested to conceal it.</p>
<p>The power and authority of a priesthood can only be maintained on
the doctrine that man is &lsquo;saved&rsquo; by the deeds of a
ceremonial law; any general belief that morality is more acceptable to
gods than ceremonies must be fatal to those occult and fictitious
virtues which hedge about every pious impostor. Sacerdotal power in
India depended on superstitions carefully fostered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>concerning the mystical properties of a
stimulating juice (soma), litanies, invocations, and benedictions by
priests; upon sacrifices to the gods, including their priests,
austerities, penances, pilgrimages, and the like; one characteristic
running through all the performances&mdash;their utter worthlessness to
any being in the universe except the priest. An artificial system of
this kind has to create its own materials, and evoke forces of
evolution from many regions of nature. It is a process requiring much
more than the wisdom of the serpent and more than its harmfulness; and
there is a bit of nature&rsquo;s irony in the fact that when the
Brahman Rishi gained supremacy, the Cobra was also worshipped as
belonging to precisely the same caste and sanctity.</p>
<p>There are traces of long and fierce struggles preceding this
consummation. Even in the Vedic age&mdash;in the very dawn of religious
history&mdash;Tetzel appears with his indulgences and Luther confronts
him. The names they bore in ancient India were Visw&aacute;mitra and
Vasishtha. Both of these were among the seven powerful Rishis who made
the hierarchy of India in the earliest age known to us. Both were
composers of some of the chief hymns of the Vedas, and their respective
hymns bear the stamp of the sacerdotal and the anti-sacerdotal parties
which contended before the priestly sway had reached its complete
triumph. Visw&aacute;mitra was champion of the high priestly party and
its political pretensions. In the Rig-Veda there are forty hymns
ascribed to him and his family, nearly all of which celebrate the
divine virtues of Soma-juice and the Soma-sacrifice. As the exaltation
of the priestly caste in Israel was connected with a miracle, in which
the Jordan stopped flowing till the ark had been carried over, so the
rivers Sutledge and Reyah were said to have rested from their course
when Visw&aacute;mitra <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>wished to cross them in seeking the Soma.
This Rishi became identified in the Hindu mind for all time with
political priestcraft. On the other hand, Vasishtha became equally
famous for his hostility to that power, as well as for his profoundly
religious character,&mdash;the finest hymns of the Vedas, as to moral
feeling, being those that bear his name. The anti-sacerdotal spirit of
Vasishtha is especially revealed in a strange satirical hymn in which
he ridicules the ceremonial Br&aacute;hmans under the guise of a
panegyric on frogs. In this composition occur such verses as
these:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like Br&aacute;hmans at the Soma-sacrifice of Atir&acirc;tra,
sitting round a full pond and talking, you, O frogs, celebrate this day
of the year when the rainy season begins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These Br&aacute;hmans, with their Soma, have had their say,
performing the annual rite. These Adhwaryus, sweating while they carry
the hot pots, pop out like hermits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have always observed the order of the gods as they are
to be worshipped in the twelvemonth; these men do not neglect their
season&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cow-noise gave, Goat-noise gave, the Brown gave, and the
Green gave us treasures. The frogs, who give us hundreds of cows,
lengthened our life in the rich autumn.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1270src" href="#xd26e1270" name="xd26e1270src">1</a></p>
<p>Visw&aacute;mitra and Vasishtha appear to have been powerful rivals
in seeking the confidence of King Sud&aacute;s, and from their varying
fortunes came the tremendous feud between them which plays so large a
part in the traditions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34"
name="pb34">34</a>]</span>of India. The men were both priests, as are
both ritualists and broad-churchmen in the present day. They were borne
on the stream of mythologic evolution to representative regions very
different from any they could have contemplated. Vasishtha, ennobled by
the moral sentiment of ages, appears as the genius of truth and
justice, maintaining these as of more &lsquo;merit&rsquo; than any
ceremonial perfections. The Br&aacute;hmans, whom he once ridiculed,
were glad enough in the end to make him their patron saint, though they
did not equally honour his principles. On the other hand,
Visw&aacute;mitra became the type of that immoral divinity which
received its Iranian anathema in Ahriman. The murder he commits is
nothing in a personage whose Soma-celebrations have raised him so high
above the trivialities of morality.</p>
<p>It is easy to see what must be the further development of such a
type as Visw&aacute;mitra when he shall have passed from the guarded
pages of puranic tradition to the terrible simplicities of folklore.
The saint whose majesty is built on &lsquo;merits,&rsquo; which have no
relation to what the humble deem virtues, naturally holds such virtues
in cynical contempt; naturally also he is indignant if any one dares to
suggest that the height he has reached by costly and prolonged
observances may be attained by poor and common people through the
practice of virtue. The next step is equally necessary. Since it is
hard to argue down the facts of human nature, Vasishtha is pretty sure
to have a strong, if sometimes silent, support for his heretical theory
of a priesthood representing virtue; consequently Visw&aacute;mitra
will be reduced at length to deny the existence of virtue, and will
become the Accuser of those to whom virtues are attributed. Finally,
from the Accuser to the Tempter the transition is inevitable. The
public Accuser must try and make good his case, and if the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>facts do
not support it, he must create other facts which will, or else bear the
last brand of his tribe&mdash;Slanderer.</p>
<p>Leaving out of sight all historical or probable facts concerning
Visw&aacute;mitra and Vasishtha, but remembering the spirit of them,
let us read the great Passion-play of the East, in which their
respective parts are performed again as intervening ages have
interpreted them. The hero of this drama is an ancient king named
Hari&#347;chandra, who, being childless, and consequently unable to
gain immortality, promised the god Varuna to sacrifice to him a son if
one were granted him. The son having been born, the father beseeches
Varuna for respite, which is granted again and again, but stands firmly
by his promise, although it is finally commuted. The repulsive features
of the ancient legend are eliminated in the drama, the promise now
being for a vast sum of money which the king cannot pay, but which
Visw&aacute;mitra would tempt him to escape by a technical fiction. Sir
Mutu Cum&aacute;ra Sw&aacute;my, whose translation I follow, presents
many evidences of the near relation in which this drama stands to the
religious faith of the people in Southern India and parts of Ceylon,
where its representation never fails to draw vast crowds from every
part of the district in which it may occur, the impression made by it
being most profound.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1290src" href=
"#xd26e1290" name="xd26e1290src">2</a></p>
<p>We are first introduced to Hari&#347;chandra, King of Ay&ograve;diah
(Oude), in his palace, surrounded by every splendour, and by the
devotion of his prosperous people. His first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>word is
an ascription to the &lsquo;God of gods.&rsquo; His ministers come
forward and recount the wealth and welfare of the nation. The first Act
witnesses the marriage of Hari&#347;chandra with the beautiful princess
Chandravat&iacute;, and it closes with the birth of a son.</p>
<p>The second Act brings us into the presence of Indra in the Abode of
the Gods. The Chief enters the Audience Hall of his palace, where an
assembly of deities and sages has awaited him. These sages are holy men
who have acquired supernatural power by their tremendous austerities;
and of these the most august is Visw&aacute;mitra. By the magnitude and
extent of his austerities he has gained a power beyond even that of the
Triad, and can reduce the worlds to cinders. All the gods court his
favour. As the Council proceeds, Indra addresses the
sages&mdash;&lsquo;Holy men! as gifted with supernatural attributes,
you roam the universe with marvellous speed, there is no place unknown
to you. I am curious to learn who, in the present times, is the most
virtuous sovereign on the earth below. What chief of mortals is there
who has never told a lie&mdash;who has never swerved from the course of
justice?&rsquo; Vasishtha, a powerful sage and family-priest of
Hari&#347;chandra, declares that his royal disciple is such a man. But
the more powerful Visw&aacute;mitra denounces Hari&#347;chandra as
cruel and a liar. The quarrel between the two Rishis waxes fierce,
until Indra puts a stop to it by deciding that an experiment shall be
made on Hari&#347;chandra. Vasishtha agrees that if his disciple can be
shown to have told a lie, or can be made to tell one, the fruit of his
life-long austerities, and all the power so gained, shall be added to
Visw&aacute;mitra; while the latter must present his opponent with half
of his &lsquo;merits&rsquo; if Hari&#347;chandra be not made to swerve
from the truth. Visw&aacute;mitra is to employ any means whatever,
neither Indra or any other interfering. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Visw&aacute;mitra sets about his task of trying and tempting
Hari&#347;chandra by informing that king that, in order to perform a
sacrifice of special importance, he has need of a mound of gold as high
as a missile slung by a man standing on an elephant&rsquo;s back. With
the demand of so sacred a being Hari&#347;chandra has no hesitation in
complying, and is about to deliver the gold when Visw&aacute;mitra
requests him to be custodian of the money for a time, but perform the
customary ceremony of transfer. Holding Hari&#347;chandra&rsquo;s
written promise to deliver the gold whensoever demanded,
Visw&aacute;mitra retires with compliments. Then wild beasts ravage
Hari&#347;chandra&rsquo;s territory; these being expelled, a demon boar
is sent, but is vanquished by the monarch. Visw&aacute;mitra then sends
unchaste dancing-girls to tempt Hari&#347;chandra; and when he has
ordered their removal, Visw&aacute;mitra returns with them, and,
feigning rage, accuses him of slaying innocent beasts and of cruelty to
the girls. He declares that unless Hari&#347;chandra yields to the
Pariah damsels, he himself shall be reduced to a Pariah slave.
Hari&#347;chandra offers all his kingdom and possessions if the demand
is withdrawn, absolutely refusing to swerve from his virtue. This
Visw&aacute;mitra accepts, is proclaimed sovereign of Ay&ograve;diah,
and the king goes forth a beggar with his wife and child. But now, as
these are departing, Visw&aacute;mitra demands that mound of gold which
was to be paid when called for. In vain Hari&#347;chandra pleads that
he has already delivered up all he possesses, the gold included; the
last concession is declared to have nothing to do with the first. Yet
Visw&aacute;mitra says he will be charitable; if Hari&#347;chandra will
simply declare that he never pledged the gold, or, having done so, does
not feel bound to pay it, he will cancel that debt. &lsquo;Such a
declaration I can never make,&rsquo; replies Hari&#347;chandra.
&lsquo;I owe thee the gold, and pay it I shall. Let a messenger
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>accompany me and leave me not till I have given
him thy due.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From this time the efforts of Visw&aacute;mitra are directed to
induce Hari&#347;chandra to declare the money not due. Amid his
heartbroken people&mdash;who cry, &lsquo;Where are the gods? Can they
tolerate this?&rsquo;&mdash;he who was just now the greatest and
happiest monarch in the world goes forth on the highway a wanderer with
his Chandravat&iacute; and their son Devar&aacute;ta dressed in
coarsest garments. His last royal deed is to set the crown on his
tempter&rsquo;s head. The people and officers follow, and beg his
permission to slay Visw&aacute;mitra, but he rebukes them, and counsels
submission. Visw&aacute;mitra orders a messenger, Nakshatra, to
accompany the three wretched ones, and inflict the severest sufferings
on them until the gold is paid, and amid each ordeal to offer
Hari&#347;chandra all his former wealth and happiness if he will utter
a falsehood.</p>
<p>They come to a desert whose sands are so hot that the wife faints.
Hari&#347;chandra bears his son in his arms, but in addition is
compelled to bear Nakshatra (the Br&aacute;hman and tormentor) on his
shoulders. They so pass amid snakes and scorpions, and receive terrible
stings; they pass through storm and flood, and yet vainly does
Nakshatra suggest the desired falsehood.</p>
<p>Then follows the ordeal of Demons, which gives an interesting
insight into Tamil Demonology. One of the company
exclaims&mdash;&lsquo;How frightful they look! Who can face them? They
come in battalions, young and old, small and great&mdash;all welcome
us. They disport themselves with a wild dance; flames shoot from their
mouths; their feet touch not the earth; they move in the air. Observe
you the bleeding corpses of human beings in their hands. They crunch
them and feed on the flesh. The place is one mass of gore and filth.
Wolves and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>hy&aelig;nas bark at them; jackals and dogs follow
them. They are near. May Siva protect us!&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nakshatra.</span> How dreadful! Hari&#347;chandra,
what is this? Look! evil demons stare at me&mdash;I tremble for my
life. Protect me now, and I ask you no more for the gold.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> Have no fear, Nakshatra.
Come, place thyself in the midst of us.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chief of the Goblins.</span> Men! little men! human
vermin! intrude ye thus into my presence? Know that, save only the
Br&aacute;hman standing in the midst of you, you are all my prey
to-night.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> Goblin! certainly thou
art not an evil-doer, for thou hast excepted this holy Br&aacute;hman.
As for ourselves, we know that the bodies which begin to exist upon
earth must also cease to exist on it. What matters it when death comes?
If he spares us now he reserves us only for another season. Good, kind
demon! destroy us then together; here we await our doom.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Nakshatra.</span> Hari&#347;chandra! before you
thus desert me, make the goblin promise you that he will not hurt
me.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> Thou hast no cause for

<p><span class="sc">Chief of the Goblins.</span> Listen! I find that
all four of you are very thin; it is not worth my while to kill you. On

<p><span class="sc">Nakshatra.</span> O Gods! O Hari&#347;chandra! you

<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> King of the Goblins! I

<p><span class="sc">The Goblin</span> (<i>grinding his teeth in great

<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> No, we cannot. We alone
are thy victims.</p>
<p>[<i>Day breaks, and the goblins disappear.</i>]</p>
<p>Having thus withstood all temptation to harm his enemy, or to break
a promise he had given to treat him kindly, Hari&#347;chandra is again
pressed for the gold or the lie, and, still holding out, an ordeal of
fire follows. Trusting the God of Fire will cease to afflict if one is
sacrificed, Hari&#347;chandra prepares to enter the conflagration
first, and a pathetic contention occurs between him and his wife and
son as to which shall be sacrificed. In the end Hari&#347;chandra
rushes in, but does not perish.</p>
<p>Hari&#347;chandra is hoping to reach the temple of Vis
Wan&agrave;th<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1385src" href="#xd26e1385"
name="xd26e1385src">3</a> at Kasi and invoke his aid to pay the gold.
To the temple he comes only to plead in vain, and Nakshatra tortures
him with instruments. Finally Hari&#347;chandra, his wife and child,
are sold as slaves to pay the debt. But Visw&aacute;mitra, invisibly
present, only redoubles his persecutions. Hari&#347;chandra is
subjected to the peculiar degradation of having to burn dead bodies in
a cemetery. Chandravat&iacute; and her son are subjected to cruelties.
The boy is one day sent to the forest, is bitten by a snake, and dies.
Chandravat&iacute; goes out in the night to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>find the
body. She repairs with it to the cemetery. In the darkness she does not
recognise her husband, the burner of the bodies, nor he his wife. He
has strictly promised his master that every fee shall be paid, and
reproaches the woman for coming in the darkness to avoid payment.
Chandravat&iacute; offers in payment a sacred chain which Siva had
thrown round her neck at birth, invisible to all but a perfect man.
Hari&#347;chandra alone has ever seen it, and now recognises his wife.
But even now he will not perform the last rites over his dead child
unless the fee can be obtained as promised. Chandravat&iacute; goes out
into the city to beg the money, leaving Hari&#347;chandra seated beside
the dead body of Devar&aacute;ta. In the street she stumbles over the
corpse of another child, and takes it up; it proves to be the infant
Prince, who has been murdered. Chandravat&iacute;&mdash;arrested and
dragged before the king&mdash;in a state of frenzy declares she has
killed the child. She is condemned to death, and her husband must be
her executioner. But the last scene must be quoted nearly in full.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Verakvoo</span> (<i>Hari&#347;chandra&rsquo;s

<p><span class="sc">Chandravat&iacute;</span> (<i>coming to

unnerved, but be prompt, and perform thy duty unflinchingly.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> My beloved wife! the days
allotted to you in this world are numbered; you have run through
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=

of this crime, there is no hope for your life; I must presently fulfil
my instructions. I can only allow you a few seconds; pray to your
tutelary deities, prepare yourself to meet your doom.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Visw&aacute;mitra</span> (<i>who has suddenly

poor woman? Wicked man, spare her! Tell a lie even now and be restored

<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> I pray, my lord, attempt
not to beguile me from the path of rectitude. Nothing shall shake my
resolution; even though thou didst offer to me the throne of Indra I
would not tell a lie. Pollute not thy sacred person by entering such
unholy grounds. Depart! I dread not thy wrath; I no longer court thy
favour. Depart. (<span class="sc">Visw&aacute;mitra</span>

<p>My love! lo I am thy executioner; come, lay thy head gently on this
block with thy sweet face turned towards the east. Chandravat&iacute;,
my wife, be firm, be happy! The last moment of our sufferings has at
length come; for to sufferings too there is happily an end. Here cease
our woes, our griefs, our pleasures. Mark! yet awhile, and thou wilt be
as free as the vultures that now soar in the skies.</p>
<p>This keen sabre will do its duty. Thou dead, thy husband dies
too&mdash;this self-same sword shall pierce my breast. First the
child&mdash;then the wife&mdash;last the husband&mdash;all victims of a
sage&rsquo;s wrath. I the martyr of Truth&mdash;thou and thy son
martyrs for me, the martyr of Truth. Yes; let us die cheerfully and
bear our ills meekly. Yes; let all men perish, let all gods cease to
exist, let the stars that shine above grow dim, let all seas be dried
up, let all mountains be levelled to the ground, let wars rage, blood
flow in streams, let millions of millions of Hari&#347;chandras be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=

Hari&#347;chandra, be ever blessed! You have borne your severe trials
most heroically, and have proved to all men that virtue is of greater

<p>Rise you, also, son of the King of Kasi, with whose murder you,

Visw&aacute;mitra. (<i>He comes to life also.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Hari&#347;chandra.</span> All my misfortunes are of
little consequence, since thou, O God of gods, hast deigned to favour
me with thy divine presence. No longer care I for kingdom, or power, or
glory. I value not children, or wives, or relations. To thy service, to
thy worship, to the redemption of my erring soul, I devote myself
uninterruptedly hereafter. Let me not become the sport of men. The
slave of a Pariah cannot become a king; the slave-girl of a
Br&aacute;hman cannot become a queen. When once the milk has been drawn
from the udder of a cow nothing can restore the self-same milk to it.
Our degradation, O God, is now beyond redemption.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Visw&aacute;mitra.</span> I pray, O Siva, that thou
wouldst pardon my folly. Anxious to gain the wager laid by me
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=

this virtuous king; yet he has proved himself the most truthful of all
earthly sovereigns, triumphing victoriously over me and my efforts to
divert him from his constancy. Hari&#347;chandra, king of kings! I
crave your forgiveness.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Verakvoo</span> (<i>throwing off his disguise</i>).

<p><span class="sc">Vasishtha.</span> Hari&#347;chandra, no disgrace
attaches to thee nor to the Solar race, of which thou art the
incomparable gem. Even this cemetery is in reality no cemetery: see!
the illusion lasts not, and thou beholdest here a holy grove the abode
of hermits and ascetics. Like the gold which has passed through
successive crucibles, devoid of all impurities, thou, O King of
Ay&ograve;diah, shinest in greater splendour than even yon god of light
now rising to our view on the orient hills. (<i>It is morning.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Siva.</span> Hari&#347;chandra, let not the world
learn that Virtue is vanquished, and that its enemy, Vice, has become

the gods, accompany this sovereign with all your retinue, and recrown

bliss await him in the other world!</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The plot of this drama has probably done as much and as various duty
as any in the world. It has spread like a spiritual banyan, whose
branches, taking root, have swelled to such size that it is difficult
now to say which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>is the original trunk. It may even be that the
only root they all had in common is an invisible one in the human
heart, developed in its necessary struggles amid nature after the pure
and perfect life.</p>
<p>But neither in the Book of Job, which we are yet to consider, nor in
any other variation of the theme, does it rise so high as in this drama
of Hari&#347;chandra. In Job it represents man loyal to his deity amid
the terrible afflictions which that deity permits; but in
Hari&#347;chandra it shows man loyal to a moral principle even against
divine orders to the contrary. Despite the hand of the licenser, and
the priestly manipulations, visible here and there in
it&mdash;especially towards the close&mdash;sacerdotalism stands
confronted by its reaction at last, and receives its sentence in the
joy with which the Hindu sees the potent Rishis with all their
pretentious &lsquo;merits,&rsquo; and the gods themselves, kneeling at
the feet of the man who stands by Truth.</p>
<p>It is amusing to find the wincings of the priests through many
centuries embodied in a legend about Hari&#347;chandra after he went to
heaven. It is related that he was induced by N&aacute;rada to relate
his actions with such unbecoming pride that he was lowered from Svarga
(heaven) one stage after each sentence; but having stopped in time, and
paid homage to the gods, he was placed with his capital in mid-air,
where eyes sacerdotally actinised may still see the aerial city at
certain times. The doctrine of &lsquo;merits&rsquo; will no doubt be
able for some time yet to charge &lsquo;good deeds&rsquo; with their
own sin&mdash;pride; but, after all, the priest must follow the people
far enough to confess that one must look upward to find the martyr of
Truth. In what direction one must look to find his accuser requires no
further intimation than the popular legend of Visw&aacute;mitra.

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sacred books of the Hebrews bring us into the
presence of the gods (Elohim) supposed to have created all things out
of nothing&mdash;nature-gods&mdash;just as they are in transition to
the conception of a single Will and Personality. Though the plural is
used (&lsquo;gods&rsquo;) a singular verb follows: the tendency is
already to that concentration which resulted in the enthronement of one
supreme sovereign&mdash;Jehovah. The long process of evolution which
must have preceded this conception is but slightly traceable in the
Bible. It is, however, written on the face of the whole world, and the
same process is going on now in its every phase. Whether with
Gesenius<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1533src" href="#xd26e1533" name=
"xd26e1533src">1</a> we take the sense of the word Elohim to be
&lsquo;the revered,&rsquo; or, with F&uuml;rst,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1536src" href="#xd26e1536" name="xd26e1536src">2</a> &lsquo;the
mighty,&rsquo; makes little difference; the fact remains that the word
is applied elsewhere to gods in general, including such as were
afterwards deemed false gods by the Jews; and it is more important
still that the actions ascribed to the Elohim, who created the heavens
and the earth, generally reflect the powerful and un-moral forces of
nature. The work of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>creation in Genesis (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=

href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%202:1-3&amp;version=NRSV">
ii. 1&ndash;3</a>) is that of giants without any moral quality
whatever. Whether or not we take in their obvious sense the words,
&lsquo;Elohim created man in his own image, &hellip; male and female
created he them,&rsquo; there can be no question of the meaning of
<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%206:1-2&amp;version=NRSV">
Gen. vi. 1, 2</a>: &lsquo;The sons of Elohim saw the daughters of men
that they were beautiful, and they took to themselves for wives
whomsoever they chose.&rsquo; When good and evil come to be spoken of,
the name Jehovah<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1551src" href="#xd26e1551"
name="xd26e1551src">3</a> at once appears. The Elohim appear again in
the Flood, the wind that assuaged it, the injunction to be fruitful and
multiply, the cloud and rainbow; and gradually the germs of a moral
government begin to appear in their assigning the violence of mankind
as reason for the deluge, and in the covenant with Noah. But even after
the name Jehovah had generally blended with, or even superseded, the
other, we find Elohim often used where strength and wonder-working are
thought of&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, &lsquo;Thou art the god that doest
wonders&rsquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps%2077&amp;version=NRSV">Ps.
lxxvii</a>.). &lsquo;Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great
waters, and thy footsteps are not known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Against the primitive nature-deities the personality and jealous
supremacy of Jehovah was defined. The golden calf built by Aaron was
called Elohim (plural, though there was but one calf). Solomon was
denounced for building altars to the same; and when Jeroboam built
altars to two calves, they are still so called. Other
rivals&mdash;Dagon (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=judg%2016&amp;version=NRSV">Judges
xvi</a>.), Astaroth, Chemosh, Milcom (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1kings%2011&amp;version=NRSV">1
Kings xi</a>.)&mdash;are called by the once-honoured name. The English
Bible translates Elohim, God; Jehovah, the <span class=
"sc">Lord</span>; Jehovah Elohim, the <span class="sc">Lord</span> God;
and the critical reader will find much that is significant in the
varied use of these names. Thus (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2022&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xxii</a>.) it is Elohim that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>demands the sacrifice of Isaac,
Jehovah that interferes to save him. At the same time, in editing the
story, it is plainly felt to be inadmissible that Abraham should be
supposed loyal to any other god than Jehovah; so Jehovah adopts the
sacrifice as meant for himself, and the place where the ram was
provided in place of Isaac is called Jehovah-Jireh. However, when we
can no longer distinguish the two antagonistic conceptions by different
names their actual incongruity is even more salient, and, as we shall
see, develops a surprising result.</p>
<p>Jehovah inaugurates his reign by a manifesto against these giants,
the Elohim, for whom the special claim&mdash;clamorously asserted when
Aaron built the Golden Calf, and continued as the plea for the same
deity&mdash;was that <i>they</i> (Elohim) had brought Israel out of
Egypt. &lsquo;I,&rsquo; cries Jehovah, &lsquo;am the Lord thy God,
which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of
bondage: thou shalt have no other gods but me;&rsquo; and the first
four commandments of the law are devoted entirely to a declaration of
his majesty, his power (claiming credit for the creation), his jealous
determination to punish his opponents and reward his friends, to
vindicate the slightest disrespect to his name. The narrative of the
Golden Calf was plainly connected with Sinai in order to illustrate the
first commandment. The punishment of the believers in another divine
emancipator, even though they had not yet received the proclamation,
must be signal. Jehovah is so enraged that by his order human victims
are offered up to the number of three thousand, and even after that, it
is said, Jehovah plagued Israel on account of their Elohim-worship. In
the same direction is the command to keep holy the Sabbath day, because
on it he rested from the work of creation (<a class="biblink xd26e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2020&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xx</a>.), or because on that day he delivered Israel from Egypt

v</a>.), the editors do not seem to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>remember exactly which, but it
is well enough to say both, for it is taking the two picked laurels
from the brow of Elohim and laying them on that of Jehovah. In all of
which it is observable that there is no moral quality whatever. Nero
might equally command the Romans to have no other gods before himself,
to speak his name with awe, to rest when he stopped working. In the
fifth commandment, arbitrarily ascribed to the First Table, we have a
transition to the moral code; though even there the honour of parents
is jealously associated with Jehovah&rsquo;s greatness (&lsquo;that thy
days may be long in the land which Jehovah Elohim giveth thee&rsquo;).
The nature-gods were equal to that; for the Elohim had begotten the
giants who were &lsquo;in the earth in those days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Elohim spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah; and
I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by (the name of)
God Almighty (<i>El-Shaddai</i>), but by my name <span class=

<p>The ancient gods&mdash;the Elohim&mdash;were, in the process of
absorption into the one great form, the repository of their several
powers, distinguishable; and though, for the most part, they bear names
related to the forces of nature, now and then they reflect the
tendencies to humanisation. Thus we have &lsquo;the most high

referred to an instance of its characteristic use, became <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>epithets, as the powers they represented were more
and more absorbed by the growing personality of Jehovah; but these
epithets were also characters, and their historic expressions had also
to undergo a process of slow and difficult digestion. The all-devouring
grandeur of Jehovah showed what it had fed on. Not only all the
honours, but many of the dishonours, of the primitive deities adhered
to the sovereign whose rule was no doubt inaugurated by their disgrace
and their barbarism. The costliness of the glory of divine absolutism
is again illustrated in the evolution of the premature monotheism,
which had for its figure-head the dread Jehovah, who, as heir of the
nature-gods, became responsible for the monstrosities of a tribal
demonolatry, thus being compelled to fill simultaneously the

the other by the moral sense of mankind&mdash;ascribed to this dual
deity, for whom unity was so fiercely insisted on, may be read in their
outcome throughout the Bible. They are here briefly, in a few examples,
set forth side by side.</p>

<p>Instances of this discrepancy might be largely multiplied. Any one
who cares to pursue the subject can trace the building upon the
powerful personal Jehovah of a religion of human sacrifices, anathemas,
and priestly despotism; while around the moral ruler and judge of the
same name, whose personality is more and more dispersed in pantheistic
ascriptions, there grows the common law, and then the more moral law of
equity, and the corresponding sentiments which gradually evolve the
idea of a parental deity.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the more this second idea of the deity prevails,
the more he is regarded as &lsquo;merciful,&rsquo;
&lsquo;long-suffering,&rsquo; &lsquo;a God of truth and without
iniquity, just and right,&rsquo; &lsquo;delighting not in sacrifice but
mercifulness,&rsquo; &lsquo;good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53"
href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>to all,&rsquo; and whose
&lsquo;tender mercies are over all his works,&rsquo; and having
&lsquo;no pleasure in the death of him that dieth;&rsquo; the less will
it be possible to see in the very same being the &lsquo;man of
war,&rsquo; &lsquo;god of battles,&rsquo; the &lsquo;jealous,&rsquo;
&lsquo;angry,&rsquo; &lsquo;fire-breathing&rsquo; one, who
&lsquo;visits the sins of the fathers upon the children,&rsquo; who
laughs at the calamities of men and mocks when their fear cometh. It is
a structural necessity of the human mind that these two shall be
gradually detached the one from the other. From one of the Jehovahs
represented in parallel columns came the &lsquo;Father&rsquo; whom
Christ adored: from the other came the Devil he abhorred. <span class=

<p class="first">The Shekinah&mdash;Jewish idols&mdash;Attributes of
the fiery and cruel Elohim compared with those of the Devil&mdash;The
powers of evil combined under a head&mdash;Continuity&mdash;The
consuming fire spiritualised.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That Abraham was a Fire-worshipper might be suspected
from the immemorial efforts of all Semitic authorities to relieve him
of traditional connection with that particular idolatry. When the good
and evil powers were being distinguished, we find the burning and the
bright aspects of Fire severally regarded. The sign of Jehovah&rsquo;s
covenant with Abram included both. &lsquo;It came to pass that when the
sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace and a burning
lamp that passed between those pieces&rsquo; (of the sacrifice). In the
legend of Moses we have the glory resting on Sinai and the burning
bush, the bush which, it is specially remarked, was &lsquo;not
consumed,&rsquo; an exceptional circumstance in honour of Moses. To
these corresponded the Urim and Thummim, marking the priest as source
of light and of judgment. In his favourable and adorable aspect Jehovah
was the Brightness of Fire. This was the Shekinah. In the Targum,
Jonathan Ben Uzziel to the Prophets, it is said: &lsquo;The mountains
trembled before the Lord; the mountains Tabor, Hermon, Carmel said one
to the other: Upon me the Shekinah will rest, and to me will it come.
But the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>Shekinah rested upon Mount Sinai, weakest and
smallest of all the mountains. This Sinai trembled and shook, and its
smoke went up as the smoke of an oven, because of the glory of the God
of Israel which had manifested itself upon it.&rsquo; The
Brightness<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1807src" href="#xd26e1807" name=
"xd26e1807src">1</a> passed on to illumine every event associated with
the divine presence in Semitic mythology; it was &lsquo;the glory of
the Lord&rsquo; shining from the Star of Bethlehem, and the figure of
the Transfiguration.</p>
<p>The Consuming Fire also had its development. Among the spiritual it
was spiritualised. &lsquo;Who among us shall dwell with the Devouring
Fire?&rsquo; cries Isaiah. &lsquo;Who among us shall dwell with the
Everlasting Burnings? He that walketh righteously and speaketh
uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his
hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil.&rsquo; It was by a
prosaic route that the Devouring Fire became the residence of the
wicked.</p>
<p>After Jeroboam (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1kings%208&amp;version=NRSV">1
Kings xiii</a>.) had built altars to the Elohim, under form of Calves,
a prophet came out of Judah to denounce the idolatry. &lsquo;And he
cried against the altar in the word of Jehovah, and said, O altar,
altar! thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a child shall be born unto the house
of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of
the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men&rsquo;s bones
shall be burnt upon thee.&rsquo; It was deemed so important that this
prophecy should be fulfilled in the letter, when it could no longer be
fulfilled in reality, that some centuries later Josiah dug up the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>bones of the Elohistic priests and burned them
upon their long-ruined altars (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2kings%2023&amp;version=NRSV">2
Kings xxiii</a>.).</p>
<p>The incident is significant, both on account of the prophet&rsquo;s
personification of the altar, and the institution of a sort of Gehenna
in connection with it. The personification and the Gehenna became much
more complete as time went on. The Jews originally had no Devil, as
indeed had no races at first; and this for the obvious reason that
their so-called gods were quite equal to any moral evils that were to
be accounted for, as we have already seen they were adequate to explain
all physical evils. But the antagonists of the moral Jehovah were
recognised and personified with increasing clearness, and were quite
prepared for connection with any General who might be theoretically
proposed for their leadership. When the Jews came under the influence
of Persian theology the archfiend was elected, and all the
Elohim&mdash;Moloch, Dagon, Astarte, Chemosh, and the rest&mdash;took
their place under his rebellious ensign.</p>
<p>The descriptions of the Devil in the Bible are mainly borrowed from
the early descriptions of the Elohim, and of Jehovah in his Elohistic
character.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1829src" href="#xd26e1829" name=

<p>In addition to the above passages may be cited a notable passage
from Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the Thessalonians (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2thess%202:3&amp;version=NRSV">ii.
3</a>). &lsquo;Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day (of
Christ) shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and
that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and
exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped;
so that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that
he is God. Remember ye not that, when I was yet with you, I told you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>these things? And now ye know what withholdeth
that he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth
already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out
of the way: and then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall
consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the
brightness of his coming: even him whose coming is after the working of
Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all the
deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they
received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. And for
this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should
believe a lie; that they all might be damned who believed not the
truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This remarkable utterance shows how potent was the survival in the
mind of Paul of the old Elohist belief. Although the ancient deity, who
deceived prophets to their destruction, and sent forth lying spirits
with their strong delusions, was dethroned and outlawed, he was still a
powerful claimant of empire, haunting the temple, and setting himself
up therein as God. He will be consumed by Christ&rsquo;s breath when
the day of triumph comes; but meanwhile he is not only allowed great
power in the earth, but utilised by the true God, who even so far
cooperates with the false as to send on some men &lsquo;strong
delusions&rsquo; (&lsquo;a working of error,&rsquo; Von Tischendorf
translates), in order that they may believe the lie and be damned. Paul
speaks of the &lsquo;mystery of iniquity;&rsquo; but it is not so very
mysterious when we consider the antecedents of his idea. The dark
problem of the origin of evil, and its continuance in the universe
under the rule of a moral governor, still threw its impenetrable shadow
across the human mind. It was a terrible reality, visible in the
indifference or hostility with which the new gospel was met on the part
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>cultured and powerful; and it could only then be
explained as a mysterious provisional arrangement connected with some
divine purpose far away in the depths of the universe. But the passage
quoted from Thessalonians shows plainly that all those early traditions
about the divinely deceived prophets and lying spirits, sent forth from
Jehovah Elohim, had finally, in Paul&rsquo;s time, become marshalled
under a leader, a personal Man of Sin; but this leader, while opposing
Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, is in some mysterious way a commissioner of
God.</p>
<p>We may remark here the beautiful continuity by which, through all
these shadows of terror and vapours of speculation, &lsquo;clouding the
glow of heaven,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2005src" href=
"#xd26e2005" name="xd26e2005src">3</a> the unquenchable ideal from
first to last is steadily ascending.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One or three things,&rsquo; says the Talmud, &lsquo;were
before this world&mdash;Water, Fire, and Wind. Water begat the
Darkness, Fire begat Light, and Wind begat the Spirit of Wisdom.&rsquo;
This had become the rationalistic translation by a crude science of the
primitive demons, once believed to have created the heavens and the
earth. In the process we find the forces outlawed in their wild action,
but becoming the choir of God in their quiet action:&mdash;</p>
<p><a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

1 Kings xix. 11&ndash;13</a>. &lsquo;And he said, Go forth, and stand
upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a
great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks
before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind
an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the
earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire
a still small voice. And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he
wrapped his face in his mantle.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>But man must have a philosophical as well as a moral development:
the human mind could not long endure this elemental anarchy. It asked,
If the Lord be not in the hurricane, the earthquake, the volcanic
flame, who <i>is</i> therein? This is the answer of the
Targum:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2032src" href="#xd26e2032" name=
"xd26e2032src">4</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;And he said, Arise and stand on the mountain before the Lord.
And God revealed himself: and before him a host of angels of the wind,
cleaving the mountain and breaking the rocks before the Lord; but not
in the host of angels was the Shechinah. And after the host of the
angels of the wind came a host of angels of commotion; but not in the
host of the angels of commotion was the Shechinah of the Lord. And
after the angels of commotion came a host of angels of fire; but not in
the host of angels of fire was the Shechinah of the Lord. But after the
host of the angels of the fire came voices singing in silence. And it
was when Elijah heard this he hid his face in his mantle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The moral sentiment takes another step in advance with the unknown
but artistic writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews. Moses had described
God as a &lsquo;consuming fire;&rsquo; and &lsquo;the sight of the
glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in
the eyes of the children of Israel&rsquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exod%2024:17&amp;version=NRSV">Exod.
xxiv. 17</a>). When next we meet this phrase it is with this writer,
who seeks to supersede what Moses (traditionally) built up.
&lsquo;Whose voice,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;then shook the earth; but
now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only,
but also heaven. And this word, &lsquo;yet once more,&rsquo; signifieth
the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are
made, that those which cannot be shaken may remain&#8202;&hellip;. For
our God is a consuming fire.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Our</i> God also!&rsquo; cries each great revolution that
advances. His consuming wrath is not now directed against man, but the
errors which are man&rsquo;s only enemies: the lightnings of the new
Sinai, while they enlighten the earth, smite the old heaven of human
faith and imagination, shrivelling it like a burnt scroll!</p>
<p>In this nineteenth century, when the old heaven, amid which this
fiery pillar glowed, is again shaken, the ancient phrase has still its
meaning. The Russian Tourgenieff represents two friends who had studied
together in early life, then parted, accidentally meeting once more for
a single night. They compare notes as to what the long intervening
years have taught them; and one sums his experience in the
words&mdash;&lsquo;I have burned what I used to worship, and worship
what I used to burn.&rsquo; The novelist artfully reproduces for this
age a sentence associated with a crisis in the religious history of
Europe. Clovis, King of the Franks, invoked the God of his wife
Clotilda to aid him against the Germans, vowing to become a Christian
if successful; and when, after his victory, he was baptized at Rheims,
St. Remy said to him&mdash;&lsquo;Bow thy head meekly, Sicambrian; burn
what thou hast worshipped, and worship what thou hast burned!&rsquo;
Clovis followed the Bishop&rsquo;s advice in literal fashion, carrying
fire and sword amid his old friends the &lsquo;Pagans&rsquo; right
zealously. But the era has come in which that which Clovis&rsquo; sword
and St. Remy&rsquo;s theology set up for worship is being consumed in
its turn. Tourgenieff&rsquo;s youths are consuming the altar on which
their forerunners were consumed. And in this rekindled flame the world
now sees shrivelling the heavens once fresh, but now reflecting the
aggregate selfishness of mankind, the hells representing their
aggregate cowardice, and feeds its nobler faith with this vision of the
eternal fire which evermore consumes the false and refines the world.

</div>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Montfaucon has among his plates one (XX.) representing
an antique agate which he supposes to represent Zeus and Athena, but
which probably relates to the myth of Herakles and Athena in the garden
of Hesperides. The hero having penetrated this garden, slays the dragon
which guards its immortalising fruit, but when he has gathered this
fruit Athena takes it from him, lest man shall eat it and share the
immortality of the gods. In this design the two stand on either side of
the tree, around which a serpent is twined from root to branches. The
history which Montfaucon gives of the agate is of equal interest with
the design itself. It was found in an old French cathedral, where it
had long been preserved and shown as a holy picture of the Temptation.
It would appear also to have previously deceived some rabbins, for on
the border is written in Hebrew characters, much more modern than the
central figures, &lsquo;The woman saw that the tree was good for food,
and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make
one wise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This mystification about a design, concerning whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>origin
and design there is now no doubt, is significant. The fable of Paradise
and the Serpent is itself more difficult to trace, so many have been
the races and religions which have framed it with their holy texts and
preserved it in their sacred precincts. In its essence, no doubt, the
story grows from a universal experience; in that aspect it is a
mystical rose that speaks all languages. When man first appears his
counterpart is a garden. The moral nature means order. The wild forces
of nature&mdash;the Elohim&mdash;build no fence, forbid no fruit. They
say to man as the supreme animal, Subdue the earth; every tree and herb
shall be your meat; every animal your slave; be fruitful and multiply.
But from the conflict the more real man emerges, and his sign is a
garden hedged in from the wilderness, and a separation between good and
evil.</p>
<p>The form in which the legend appears in the Book of Genesis presents
one side in which it is simple and natural. This has already been
suggested (vol. i. p. 330). But the legend of man defending his refuge
from wild beasts against the most subtle of them is here overlaid by a
myth in which it plays the least part. The mind which reads it by such
light as may be obtained only from biblical sources can hardly fail to
be newly puzzled at every step. So much, indeed, is confessed in the
endless and diverse theological theories which the story has elicited.
What is the meaning of the curse on the Serpent that it should for ever
crawl thereafter? Had it not crawled previously? Why was the Tree of
the knowledge of Good and Evil forbidden? Why, when its fruit was
tasted, should the Tree of Life have been for the first time forbidden
and jealously guarded? These riddles are nowhere solved in the Bible,
and have been left to the fanciful inventions of theologians and the
ingenuity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>rabbins. Dr. Adam Clarke thought the Serpent was
an ape before his sin, and many rabbins concluded he was camel-shaped;
but the remaining enigmas have been fairly given up.</p>
<p>The ancient Jews, they who wrote and compiled the Old Testament,
more candid than their modern descendants and our omniscient
christians, silently confessed their inability to make anything out of
this snake-story. From the third chapter of Genesis to the last verse
of Malachi the story is not once alluded to! Such a phenomenon would
have been impossible had this legend been indigenous with the Hebrew
race. It was clearly as a boulder among them which had floated from
regions little known to their earlier writers; after lying naked
through many ages, it became overgrown with rabbinical lichen and moss,
and, at the Christian era, while it seemed part of the Hebrew
landscape, it was exceptional enough to receive special reverence as a
holy stone. That it was made the corner-stone of Christian theology may
be to some extent explained by the principle of <i lang="la">omne
ignotum pro mirifico</i>. But the boulder itself can only be explained
by tracing it to the mythologic formation from which it crumbled.</p>
<p>How would a Parsi explain the curse on a snake which condemned it to
crawl? He would easily give us evidence that at the time when most of
those Hebrew Scriptures were written, without allusion to such a
Serpent, the ancient Persians believed that Ahriman had tempted the
first man and woman through his evil mediator, his anointed son,
Ash-Mogh, &lsquo;the two-footed Serpent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But let us pass beyond the Persian legend, carrying that and the
biblical story together, for submission to the criticism of a
Br&aacute;hman. He will tell us that this Ash-Mogh of the Parsi is
merely the ancient A&egrave;shma-da&eacute;va <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>of the
Avesta, which in turn is Ahi, the great Vedic Serpent-monster whom
Indra &lsquo;prostrated beneath the feet&rsquo; of the stream he had
obstructed&mdash;every stream having its deity. He would remind us that
the Vedas describe the earliest dragon-slayer, Indra, as
&lsquo;crushing the head&rsquo; of his enemy, and that this figure of
the god with his heel on a Serpent&rsquo;s head has been familiar to
his race from time immemorial. And he would then tell us to read the
Rig-Veda, v. 32, and the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, and we would find
all the elements of the story told in Genesis.</p>
<p>In the hymn referred to we find a graphic account of how, when Ahi
was sleeping on the waters he obstructed, Indra hurled at him his
thunderbolt. It says that when Indra had &lsquo;annihilated the weapon
of that mighty beast from him (Ahi), another, more powerful, conceiving
himself one and unmatched, was generated,&rsquo; This &lsquo;wrath-born
son,&rsquo; &lsquo;a walker in darkness,&rsquo; had managed to get hold
of the sacred Soma, the plant monopolised by the gods, and having drunk
this juice, he lay slumbering and <span class="corr" id="xd26e2086"
title="Not in source">&lsquo;</span>enveloping the world,&rsquo; and
then &lsquo;fierce Indra seized upon him,&rsquo; and having previously
discovered &lsquo;the vital part of him who thought, himself
invulnerable,&rsquo; struck that incarnation of many-formed Ahi, and he
was &lsquo;<i>made the lowest of all creatures</i>&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But one who has perused the philological biography of Ahi already
given, vol. i. p. 357, will not suppose that this was the end of him.
We must now consider in further detail the great episode of the
Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, to which reference has been made in other
connections.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2097src" href="#xd26e2097"
name="xd26e2097src">1</a> During the Deluge the most precious treasure
of the gods, the Amrita, the ambrosia that rendered them immortal, was
lost, and the poem relates how the Devas and Asuras, otherwise gods
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>and serpents, together churned the ocean for it.
There were two great mountains,&mdash;Meru the golden and beautiful,
adorned with healing plants, pleasant streams and trees, unapproachable
by the sinful, guarded by serpents; Mandar, rocky, covered with rank
vegetation, infested by savage beasts. The first is the abode of the
gods, the last of demons. To find the submerged Amrita it was necessary
to uproot Mandar and use it to churn the ocean. This was done by
calling on the King Serpent Ananta, who called in the aid of another
great serpent, V&aacute;suki, the latter being used as a rope coiling
and uncoiling to whirl the mountain. At last the Amrita appeared. But
there also streamed forth from the ocean bed a terrible stench and
venom, which was spreading through the universe when Siva swallowed it
to save mankind,&mdash;the drug having stained his throat blue, whence
his epithet &lsquo;Blue Neck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the Asuras saw the Amrita, they claimed it; but one of the
Devas, Narya, assumed the form of a beautiful woman, and so fascinated
them that they forgot the Amrita for the moment, which the gods drank.
One of the Asuras, however, R&aacute;hu, assumed the form of a god or
Deva, and began to drink. The immortalising nectar had not gone farther
than his throat when the sun and moon saw the deceit and discovered it
to Naraya, who cut off R&aacute;hu&rsquo;s head. The head of
R&aacute;hu, being immortal, bounded to the sky, where its efforts to
devour the sun and moon, which betrayed him, causes their eclipses. The
tail (Ketu) also enjoys immortality in a lower plane, and is the fatal
planet which sends diseases on mankind. A furious war between the gods
and the Asuras has been waged ever since. And since the Devas are the
strongest, it is not wonderful that it should have passed into the
folklore of the whole Aryan world that the evil host are for ever
seeking to recover by cunning the Amrita. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>Serpents
guarding the paradise of the Devas have more than once, in a mythologic
sense, been induced to betray their trust and glide into the divine
precincts to steal the coveted draught. This is the
Kv&aacute;sir<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2107src" href="#xd26e2107"
name="xd26e2107src">2</a> of the Scandinavian Mythology, which is the
source of that poetic inspiration whose songs have magical potency. The
sacramental symbol of the Amrita in Hindu Theology is the Soma juice,
and this plant Indra is declared in the Rig-Veda (i. 130) to have
discovered &ldquo;hidden, like the nestlings of a bird, amidst a pile
of rocks enclosed by bushes,&rdquo; where the dragon Drought had
concealed it. Indra, in the shape of a hawk, flew away with it. In the
Prose Edda the Frost Giant Suttung has concealed the sacred juice, and
it is kept by the maid Gunlauth in a cavern overgrown with bushes.
Bragi bored a hole through the rock. Odin in the shape of a worm crept
through the crevice; then resuming his godlike shape, charmed the maid
into permitting him to drink one draught out of the three jars; and,
having left no drop, in form of an eagle flew to Asgard, and discharged
in the jars the wonder-working liquid. Hence poetry is called
Odin&rsquo;s booty, and Odin&rsquo;s gift.</p>
<p>Those who attentively compare these myths with the legend in Genesis
will not have any need to rest upon the doubtful etymology of
&lsquo;Adam&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2115src" href=
"#xd26e2115" name="xd26e2115src">3</a> to establish the Ayran
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>origin of the latter. The Tree of the knowledge of
Good and Evil which made man &lsquo;as one of us&rsquo; (the Elohim) is
the Soma of India, the Haoma of Persia, the <i>kv&aacute;sir</i> of
Scandinavia, to which are ascribed the intelligence and powers of the
gods, and the ardent thoughts of their worshippers. The Tree of
Immortality is the Amrita, the only monopoly of the gods. &lsquo;The
Lord God said, Behold the man is become as one of us, to know good and
evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the Lord God sent him forth
the garden of Eden to till the ground whence he had been taken. So he
drove out the man; and he placed on the east of the garden of Eden
cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way
of the tree of life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This flaming sword turning every way is independent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>of the
cherub, and takes the place of the serpent which had previously guarded
the Meru paradise, but is now an enemy no longer to be trusted.</p>
<p>If the reader will now re-read the story in Genesis with the old
names restored, he will perceive that there is no puzzle at all in any
part of it:&mdash;&lsquo;Now R&aacute;hu [because he had stolen and
tasted Soma] was more subtle than any beast of the field which the
Devas had made, and he said to Adea Suktee, the first woman, Have the
Devas said you shall not eat of every tree in the garden? And she said
unto R&aacute;hu, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;
but of the Soma-plant, which is in the middle of the garden, the Devas
have said we shall not eat or touch it on pain of death. Then
R&aacute;hu said to Adea, You will not suffer death by tasting Soma [I
have done so, and live]: the Devas know that on the day when you taste
it your eyes shall be opened, and you will be equal to them in
knowledge of good and evil &hellip; [and you will be able at once to
discover which tree it is that bears the fruit which renders you
immortal&mdash;the Amrita]&hellip;. Adea took of the Soma and did eat,
and gave also unto Adima, her husband, and the eyes of them both were
opened&#8202;&hellip;. And Indra, chief of the Devas, said to
R&aacute;hu, Because you have done this, you are cursed above all
cattle and above every beast of the field; [for they shall
transmigrate, their souls ascend through higher forms to be absorbed in
the Creative principle; but] upon thy belly shalt thou go [remaining
transfixed in the form you have assumed to try and obtain the Amrita];
and [instead of the ambrosia you aimed at] you shall eat dirt
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2168" title="Source: though">through</span>
all your existence&#8202;&hellip;. And Indra said, Adima and Adea
Suktee have [tasted Soma, and] become as one of us Devas [so far as] to
know good and evil; and now, lest man put forth his hand [on our
precious Amrita], and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>live for ever [giving us another race of Asuras or
Serpent-men to compete with]&hellip;. Indra and the Devas drove Adima
out of Meru, and placed watch-dogs at the east of the garden; and [a
sinuous darting flame, precisely matched to the now unchangeable form
of R&aacute;hu], a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the
way of the Amrita from Adima and Asuras.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the gods and serpents were churning the ocean for the Amrita,
all woes and troubles for mortals came up first. That ocean shrinks in
one region to the box of Pandora, in another to the fruit eaten by Eve.
How foreign such a notion is to the Hebrew theology is shown by the
fact that even while the curses are falling from the fatal fruit on the
earth and man, they are all said to have proceeded solely from Jehovah,
who is thus made to supplement the serpent&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>It will be seen that in the above version of the story in Genesis I
have left out various passages. These are in part such as must be more
fully treated in the succeeding chapter, and in part the Semitic mosses
which have grown upon the Aryan boulder. But even after the slight
treatment which is all I have space to devote to the comparative study
of the myth in this aspect, it may be safely affirmed that the problems
which we found insoluble by Hebrew correlatives no longer exist if an
Aryan origin be assumed. We know why the fruit of knowledge was
forbidden: because it endangered the further fruit of immortality. We
know how the Serpent might be condemned to crawl for ever without
absurdity: because he was of a serpent-race, able to assume higher
forms, and capable of transmigration, and of final absorption. We know
why the eating of the fruit brought so many woes: it was followed by
the stream of poison from the churned ocean which accompanied the
Amrita, and which would have destroyed the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>race of
both gods and men, had not Siva drank it up. If anything were required
to make the Aryan origin of the fable certain, it will be found in the
fact which will appear as we go on,&mdash;namely, that the rabbins of
our era, in explaining the legend which their fathers severely ignored,
did so by borrowing conceptions foreign to the original ideas of their
race,&mdash;notions about human transformation to animal shapes, and
about the Serpent (which Moses honoured), and mainly of a kind
travestying the Iranian folklore. Such contact with foreign races for
the first time gave the Jews any key to the legend which their
patriarchs and prophets were compelled to pass over in silence.

Sanskrit <i>Adima</i> means &lsquo;the first;&rsquo; in Hebrew
<i>Adam</i> (given almost always with the article) means &lsquo;the
red,&rsquo; and it is generally derived from <i>adamah</i>, mould or
soil. But Professor Max M&uuml;ller (Science of Religion, p. 320) says
if the name <i>Adima</i> (used, by the way, in India for the first man,
as <i>Adam</i> is in England) is the same as <i>Adam</i>, &lsquo;we
should be driven to admit that Adam was borrowed by the Jews from the
Hindus.&rsquo; But even that mild case of &lsquo;driving&rsquo; is
unnecessary, since the word, as Sale reminded the world, is used in the
Persian legend. It is probable that the Hebrews imported this word not
knowing its meaning, and as it resembled their word for mould, they
added the gloss that the first man was made of the dust or mould of the
ground. It is not contended that the Hebrews got their word directly
from the Hindu or Persian myth. Mr. George Smith discovered that Admi
or Adami was the name for the first men in Chaldean fragments. Sir
Henry Rawlinson points out that the ancient Babylonians recognised two
principle races,&mdash;the Adamu, or dark, and the Sarku, or light,
race; probably a distinction, remembered in the phrase of Genesis,
between the supposed sons of Adam and the sons of God. The dark race
was the one that fell. Mr. Herbert Spencer (<i>Principles of
Sociology</i>, Appendix) offers an ingenious suggestion that the
prohibition of a certain sacred fruit may have been the provision of a
light race against a dark one, as in Peru only the Yuca and his
relatives were allowed to eat the stimulating <i>cuca</i>. If this be
true in the present case, it would still only reflect an earlier
tradition that the holy fruit was the rightful possession of the
deities who had won in the struggle for it.</p>
<p class="footnote cont">Nor is there wanting a survival from Indian
tradition in the story of Eve. Adam said, &lsquo;This now is bone of my
bone, and flesh of my flesh.&rsquo; In the Manu Code (ix. 22) it is
written: &lsquo;The bone of woman is united with the bone of man, and
her flesh with his flesh.&rsquo; The Indian Adam fell in twain,
becoming male and female (Yama and Yami). Ewald (Hist. of Israel, i. 1)
has put this matter of the relation between Hebrew and Hindu
traditions, as it appears to me, beyond doubt. See also
Goldziher&rsquo;s Heb. Mythol., p. 326; and Professor King&rsquo;s
<i>Gnostics</i>, pp. 9, 10, where the historic conditions under which
the importation would naturally have occurred are succinctly set forth.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The insignificance of the Serpent of Eden in the
scheme and teachings of the Hebrew Bible is the more remarkable when it
is considered that the pessimistic view of human nature is therein
fully represented. In the story of the Temptation itself, there is,
indeed, no such generalisation as we find in the modern dogma of the
Fall of Man; but the elements of it are present in the early assumption
that the thoughts of man&rsquo;s heart run to evil
continually,&mdash;which must be an obvious fact everywhere while
goodness is identified with fictitious merits. There are also
expressions suggesting a theory of heredity, of a highly superstitious
character,&mdash;the inheritance being by force of the ancestral word
or act, and without reference to inherent qualities. Outward merits and
demerits are transmitted for reward and punishment to the third and
fourth generation; but the more common-sense view appears to have
gradually superseded this, as expressed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>in the proverb that the
fathers ate sour grapes and the children&rsquo;s teeth were on
edge.</p>
<p>In accounting for this condition of human nature, popular traditions
among the Jews always pointed rather to a fall of the gods than to any
such catastrophe to man. &lsquo;The sons of the Elohim (gods) saw the
daughters of men that they were beautiful, and they took to themselves
for wives whomsoever they chose.&rsquo; &lsquo;There were giants in the
earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in
unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same
became mighty men, which were of old men of renown.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2195src" href="#xd26e2195" name="xd26e2195src">1</a>
These giants were to the Semitic mind what the Ahis, Vritras, Sushnas
and other monsters were to the Aryan, or Titans to the Greek mind. They
were not traced to the Serpent, but to the wild nature-gods, the
Elohim, and when Jehovah appears it is to wage war against them. The
strength of this belief is illustrated in the ample accounts given in
the Old Testament of the Rephaim and their king Og, the Anakim and
Goliath, the Emim, the Zamzummim, and others, all of which gained full
representation in Hebrew folklore. The existence of these hostile
beings was explained by their fall from angelic estate.</p>
<p>The Book of Enoch gives what was no doubt the popular understanding
of the fall of the angels and its results. Two hundred angels took
wives of the daughters of men, and their offspring were giants three
thousand yards in height. These giants having consumed the food of
mankind, began to devour men, whose cries were brought to the attention
of Jehovah by his angels. One angel was sent to warn Noah of the Flood;
another to bind Azazel in a dark place in the desert till the Judgment
Day; Gabriel was despatched to set the giants to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>destroying one another; Michael was sent to bury
the fallen angels under the hills for seventy generations, till the Day
of Judgment, when they should be sent to the fiery abyss for ever. Then
every evil work should come to an end, and the plant of righteousness
spring up.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2204src" href="#xd26e2204" name=
"xd26e2204src">2</a></p>
<p>Such exploits and successes on the part of the legal Deity against
outlaws, though they may be pitched high in heroic romance, are found
beside a theology based upon a reverse situation. Nothing is more
fundamental in the ancient Jewish system than the recognition of an
outside world given over to idolatry and wickedness, while Jews are a
small colony of the children of Israel and chosen of Jehovah. Such a
conception in primitive times is so natural, and possibly may have been
so essential to the constitution of nations, that it is hardly useful
to look for parallels. Though nearly all races see in their traditional
dawn an Age of Gold, a Happy Garden, or some corresponding felicity,
these are normally defined against anterior chaos or surrounding
ferocity. Every Eden has had its guards.</p>
<p>When we come to legends which relate particularly to the way in
which the early felicity was lost, many facts offer themselves for
comparative study. And with regard to the myths of Eden and Eve, we may
remark what appears to have been a curious interchange of legends
between the Hebrews and Persians. The ancient doctrines of India and
Persia concerning Origins are largely, if not altogether, astronomical.
In the Genesis of India we see a golden egg floating on a shoreless
ocean; it divides to make the heaven above and earth beneath; from it
emerges Praj&aacute;pati, who also falls in twain to make the mortal
and immortal substances; the parts of him again divide to make men and
women on earth, sun and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=
"#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>moon in the sky. This is but one
version out of many, but all the legends about Praj&aacute;pati
converge in making him a figure of Indian astronomy. In the Rig-Veda he
is Orion, and for ever lies with the three arrows in his belt which
Sirius shot at him because of his love for Aldebaran,&mdash;towards
which constellation he stretches. Now, in a sort of antithesis to this,
the evil R&aacute;hu is also cut in twain, his upper and immortal part
pursuing and trying to eclipse the sun and moon, his tail (Ketu)
becoming the 9th planet, shedding evil influences on mankind.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2213src" href="#xd26e2213" name="xd26e2213src">3</a>
This tail, Ketu, is quite an independent monster, and we meet with him
in the Persian planisphere, where he rules the first of the six
mansions of Ahriman, and is the &lsquo;crooked serpent&rsquo; mentioned
in the Book of Job. By referring to vol. i. p. 253, the reader will see
that this Star-serpent must stand as close to the woman with her child
and sheaf as September stands to October. But unquestionably the woman
was put there for honour and not disgrace; with her child and sheaf she
represented the fruitage of the year.</p>
<p>There is nothing in Persian Mythology going to show that the woman
betrayed her mansion of fruitage&mdash;the golden year&mdash;to the
Serpent near her feet. In the Bundehesch we have the original man,
Kaiomarts, who is slain by Ahriman as Praj&aacute;pati (Orion) was by
Sirius; from his dead form came Meschia and Meschiane, the first human
pair. Ahriman corrupts them by first giving them goats&rsquo; milk, an
evil influence from Capricorn. After they had thus injured themselves
he tempted them with a fruit which robbed them of ninety-nine
hundredths of their happiness. In all this there is no indication that
the woman and man bore different relations to the calamity. But after a
time we find a Pars&icirc; postscript to this effect: &lsquo;The woman
was the first to sacrifice to the Devas.&rsquo; This <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>is the
one item in the Pars&icirc; Mythology which shows bias against woman,
and as it is unsupported by the narratives preceding it, we may suppose
that it was derived from some foreign country.</p>
<p>That country could hardly have been India. There is a story in
remote districts of India which relates that the first woman was born
out of an expanding lotus on the Ganges, and was there received in his
paradise by the first man (Adima, or Manu). Having partaken of the
Soma, they were expelled, after first being granted their prayer to be
allowed a last draught from the Ganges; the effect of the holy water
being to prevent entire corruption, and secure immortality to their
souls. But nowhere in Indian legend or folklore do we find any special
dishonour put upon woman such as is described in the Hebrew story.</p>
<p>Rather we find the reverse. Early in the last century, a traveller,
John Marshall, related stories of the creation which he says were told
him by the Brahmins, and others &lsquo;by the Brahmins of
Persia.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2230src" href="#xd26e2230"
name="xd26e2230src">4</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Once on a time,&rsquo; the Brahmins said, &lsquo;as (God) was
set in eternity, it came into his mind to make something, and
immediately no sooner had he thought the same, but that the same minute
was a perfect beautiful woman present immediately before him, which he
called Adea Suktee, that is, the first woman. Then this figure put into
his mind the figure of a man; which he had no sooner conceived in his
mind, but that he also started up, and represented himself before him;
this he called Manapuise, that is, the first man; then, upon a
reflection of these things, he resolved further to create several
places for them to abide in, and accordingly, assuming a subtil body,
he breathed in a minute the whole universe, and everything therein,
from the least to the greatest.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;The Brahmins of Persia tell certain long stories of a great
Giant that was led into a most delicate garden, which, upon certain
conditions, should be his own for ever. But one evening in a cool shade
one of the wicked Devatas, or spirits, came to him, and tempted him
with vast sums of gold, and all the most precious jewels that can be
imagined; but he courageously withstood that temptation, as not knowing
what value or use they were of: but at length this wicked Devata
brought to him a fair woman, who so charmed him that for her sake he
most willingly broke all his conditions, and thereupon was turned
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the first of these two stories the names given to the man and
woman are popular words derived from Sanskrit. In the second the
Persian characters are present, as in the use of Devatas to denote
wicked powers; but for the rest, this latter legend appears to me
certainly borrowed from the Jews so far as the woman is concerned. It
was they who first perceived any connection between Virgo in the sixth
mansion of Ormuzd, and Python in the seventh, and returned the Persians
their planisphere with a new gloss. Having adopted the Dragon&rsquo;s
tail (Ketu) for a little preliminary performance, the Hebrew system
dismisses that star-snake utterly; for it has already evolved a
terrestrial devil from its own inner consciousness.</p>
<p>The name of that devil is&mdash;<span class="sc">Woman</span>. The
diabolisation of woman in their theology and tradition is not to be
regarded as any indication that the Hebrews anciently held women in
dishonour; rather was it a tribute to her powers of fascination such as
the young man wrote to be placed under the pillow of
Darius&mdash;&lsquo;Woman is strongest.&rsquo; As Darius and his
council agreed that, next to truth, woman is strongest&mdash;stronger
than wine or than kings, so do the Hebrew fables testify by
interweaving her beauty and genius with every evil of the world.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=

<p>Between the Elohist and Jahvist accounts of the creation of man,
there are two differences of great importance. The Elohim are said to
have <i>created</i> man in their own image, male and female,&mdash;the
word for &lsquo;created&rsquo; being <i>bar&aacute;</i>, literally
meaning to <i>carve</i> out. Jehovah Elohim is said to have
<i>formed</i> man,&mdash;nothing being said about his own image, or
about male and female,&mdash;the word <i>formed</i> being
<i>yatsar&rsquo;</i>. The sense of this word <i>yatsar</i> in this
place (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%202:7&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
ii. 7</a>) must be interpreted by what follows: Jehovah is said to have
formed man out of the <i>aphar&rsquo;</i>, which the English version
translates dust, but the Septuagint more correctly <i>sperma</i>. The
literal meaning is a finely volatilised substance, and in <a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num%2023:10&amp;version=NRSV">
Numbers xxiii. 10</a>, it is used to represent the seed of Jacob. In
the Jehovistic creation it means that man was formed out of the seminal
principle of the earth combined with the breath of Jehovah; and the
legend closely resembles the account of the ancient
Satapatha-Br&aacute;hmana, which shows the creative power in sexual
union with the fluid world to produce the egg from which
Praj&aacute;pati was born, to be divided into man and woman.</p>
<p>These two accounts, therefore,&mdash;to wit, that in the first and
that in the second chapter of Genesis,&mdash;must be regarded as being
of different events, and not merely varying myths of the same event.
The offspring of Jehovah were &lsquo;living souls,&rsquo; an expression
not used in connection with the created images of the giants or Elohim.
The Elohist pair roam about the world freely eating all fruits and
herbs, possessing nature generally, and, as male and female, encouraged
to increase and multiply; but Jehovah carefully separates <i>his</i>
two children from general nature, places them in a garden, forbids
certain food, and does not say a word about sex even, much less
encourage its functions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href=
"#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>Adam was formed simply to be the gardener of Eden; no other motive
is assigned. In proposing the creation of a being to be his helper and
companion, nothing is said about a new sex,&mdash;the word translated
&lsquo;help-meet&rsquo; (<i>&eacute;zer</i>) is masculine. Adam names
the being made &lsquo;woman,&rsquo; (Vulg. <i>Virago</i>) only because
she has been made out of man, but sex is not even yet suggested. This
is so marked that the compiler has filled up what he considered an
omission with (verse 24) a little lecture on duty to wives.</p>
<p>It is plain that the jealously-guarded ambrosia of Aryan gods has
here been adapted to signify the sexual relation. That is the fruit in
the midst of the garden which is reserved. The eating of it is
immediately associated with consciousness of nudity and shame. The
curse upon Eve is appropriate. Having taken a human husband, she is to
be his slave; she shall bring forth children in sorrow, and many of
them (Gen. iii. 16). Adam is to lose his position in Jehovah&rsquo;s
garden, and to toil in accursed ground, barren and thorny.</p>
<p>Cast out thus into the wilderness, the human progeny as it increased
came in contact with the giant&rsquo;s progeny,&mdash;those created by
the Elohim (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%201&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
i</a>.). When these had intermarried, Jehovah said that the fact that
the human side in such alliance had been originally vitalised by his
breath could not now render it immortal, because &lsquo;he (man) also
is flesh,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>, like the creatures of the nature-gods.
After two great struggles with these Titans, drowning most of them,
hurling down their tower and scattering them, Jehovah resolved upon a
scheme of vast importance, and one which casts a flood of light upon
the narrative just given. Jehovah&rsquo;s great aim is shown in the
Abrahamic covenant to be to found a family on earth, of which he can
say, &lsquo;Thou art my son; I have begotten thee.&rsquo; Eve
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>was meant to be the mother of that family, but by
yielding to her passion for the man meant only to be her companion she
had thwarted the purpose of Jehovah. But she reappears again under the
name of Sara; and from first to last the sense of these records,
however overlaid by later beliefs, is the expansion, varying fortunes,
and gradual spiritualisation of this aspiration of a deity for a family
of his own in the earth.</p>
<p>Celsus said that the story of the Virgin Mary and the Holy Ghost is
one in which Christians would find little &lsquo;mystery&rsquo; if the
names were Dana&euml; and Jupiter. The same may be said of the story of
Sara and Jehovah, of which that concerning Mary is a theological
travesty. Sarai (as she was called before her transfer to Jehovah, who
then forbade Abraham to call her &lsquo;<i>My</i> Princess,&rsquo; but
only &lsquo;Princess&rsquo;) was chosen because she was childless.
Abraham was paid a large recompense for her surrender, and provision
was made that he should have a mistress, and by her a son. This natural
son was to be renowned and have great possessions; nominally Abraham
was to be represented by Sara&rsquo;s miraculously-conceived son, and
to control his fortunes, but the blood of the new race was to be purely
divine in its origin, so that every descendant of Isaac might be of
Jehovah&rsquo;s family in Abraham&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p>Abraham twice gave over his wife to different kings who were
jealously punished by Jehovah for sins they only came near committing
unconsciously, while Abraham himself was not even rebuked for the sin
he did commit. The forbidden fruit was not eaten this time; and the
certificate and proof of the supernatural conception of Isaac were made
clear in Sarah&rsquo;s words&mdash;&lsquo;God hath made me to laugh:
all that hear will laugh with me: who would have said unto Abraham that
Sarah should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>have given children suck? for I have borne a son
in his old age.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2318src" href=
"#xd26e2318" name="xd26e2318src">5</a></p>
<p>It was the passionate nature and beauty of Woman which had thus far
made the difficulty. The forbidden fruit was &lsquo;pleasant to the
eyes,&rsquo; and Eve ate it; and it was her &lsquo;voice&rsquo; to
which Adam had hearkened rather than to that of Jehovah (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%203:17&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
iii. 17</a>). And, again, it was the easy virtue and extreme beauty of
Sara (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2012:11-14&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xii. 11, 14</a>) which endangered the new scheme. The rabbinical
traditions are again on this point very emphatic. It is related that
when Abram came to the border of Egypt he hid Sara in a chest, and was
so taking her into that country. The collector of customs charged that
the chest contained raiment, silks, gold, pearls, and Abram paid for
all these; but this only increased the official&rsquo;s suspicions, and
he compelled Abram to open the chest; when this was done and Sara rose
up, the whole land of Egypt was illumined by her splendour.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2332src" href="#xd26e2332" name=
"xd26e2332src">6</a></p>
<p>There is no reason for supposing that the ideas underlying the
relation which Jehovah meant to establish with Eve, and succeeded in
establishing with Sara, were of a merely sensual description. These
myths belong to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>mental region of ancestor-worship, and the
fundamental conception is that of founding a family to reign over all
other families. Jehovah&rsquo;s interest is in Isaac rather than Sara,
who, after she has borne that patriarch, lapses out of the story almost
as completely as Eve. The idea is not, indeed, so theological as it
became in the Judaic-christian legend of the conception of Jesus by
Mary as spouse of the Deity; it was probably, however, largely ethnical
in the case of Eve, and national in that of Sara.</p>
<p>It being considered of the utmost importance that all who claimed
the advantages in the Jewish commonwealth accruing only to the legal,
though nominal, &lsquo;children of Abraham,&rsquo; should really be of
divine lineage, security must be had against Isaac having any full
brother. It might be that in after time some natural son of Sara might
claim to be the one born of divine parentage, might carry on the Jewish
commonwealth, slay the children of Jehovah by Sara, and so end the
divine lineage with the authority it carried. Careful precautions
having been taken that Ishmael should be an
&lsquo;irreconcilable,&rsquo; there is reason to suspect that the
position of Isaac as Jehovah&rsquo;s &lsquo;only-begotten son&rsquo;
was secured by means obscurely hinted in the circumcision first
undergone by Abraham, and made the sign of the covenant. That
circumcision, wheresoever it has survived, is the relic of a more
horrible practice of barbarian asceticism, is hardly doubtful; that the
original rite was believed to have been that by which Abraham fulfilled
his contract with Jehovah, appears to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>me intimated in various
passages of the narrative which have survived editorial arrangement in
accordance with another view. For instance, the vast inducements
offered Abraham, and the great horror that fell on the patriarch,
appear hardly explicable on the theory that nothing was conceded on
Abraham&rsquo;s side beyond the surrender of a wife whom he had freely
consigned to earthly monarchs.</p>
<p>Though the suspicion just expressed as to the nature of
Abraham&rsquo;s circumcision may be doubted, it is not questionable
that the rite of circumcision bears a significance in rabbinical
traditions and Jewish usages which renders its initiation by Abraham at
least a symbol of marital renunciation. Thus, the custom of placing in
a room where the rite of circumcision was performed a pot of dust, was
explained by the rabbins to have reference to the dust which Jehovah
declared should be the serpent&rsquo;s food.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2347src" href="#xd26e2347" name="xd26e2347src">7</a> That
circumcision should have been traditionally associated with the
temptation of Eve is a confirmation of the interpretation which regards
her (Eve) as the prototype of Sara and the serpent as sexual
desire.</p>
<p>Although, if the original sense of Abraham&rsquo;s circumcision were
what has been suggested, it had been overlaid, when the Book of Genesis
in its present form was compiled, by different traditions, and that
patriarch is described as having married again and had other children,
the superior sanctity of Sara&rsquo;s son was preserved. Indeed, there
would seem to have continued for a long time a tradition that the
Abrahamic line and covenant were to be carried out by &lsquo;the seed
of the woman&rsquo; alone, and the paternity of Jehovah. Like Sara,
Rebekah is sterile, and after her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85"
href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>Rachel; the birth of Jacob and
Esau from one, and of Joseph and Benjamin from the other, being through
the intervention of Jehovah.</p>
<p>The great power of woman for good or evil, and the fact that it has
often been exercised with subtlety&mdash;the natural weapon of the weak
in dealing with the strong&mdash;are remarkably illustrated in the
legends of these female figures which appear in connection with the
divine schemes in the Book of Genesis. But even more the perils of
woman&rsquo;s beauty are illustrated, especially in Eve and Sara. There
were particular and obvious reasons why these representative women
could not be degraded or diabolised in their own names or history, even
where their fascinations tended to countervail the plans of Jehovah.
The readiness with which Sara promoted her husband&rsquo;s prostitution
and consented to her own, the treachery of Rebekah to her son Esau,
could yet not induce Jewish orthodoxy to give evil names to the
Madonnas of their race; but the inference made was expressed under
other forms and names. It became a settled superstition that wherever
evil was going on, Woman was at the bottom of it. Potiphar&rsquo;s
wife, Jezebel, Vashti, and Delilah, were among the many she-scape-goats
on whom were laid the offences of their august official predecessors
who &lsquo;could do no wrong.&rsquo; Even after Satan has come upon the
scene, and is engaged in tempting Job, it seems to have been thought
essential to the task that he should have an agent beside the troubled
man in the wife who bade him &lsquo;curse God and die.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is impossible to say at just what period the rabbins made their
ingenious discovery that the devil and Woman entered the world at the
same time,&mdash;he coming out of the hole left by removal of the rib
from Adam before it was closed. This they found disclosed in the fact
that it is in Genesis iii. 21, describing the creation of Woman, that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>there appears for the first time
<i>Samech</i>&mdash;the serpent-letter S (in <i>Vajisgor</i>).<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2371src" href="#xd26e2371" name="xd26e2371src">8</a>
But there were among them many legends of a similar kind that leave one
no wonder concerning the existence of a thanksgiving taught boys that
they have not been created women, however much one may be scandalised
at its continuance in the present day. It was only in pursuance of this
theory of Woman that there was developed at a later day a female
assistant of the Devil in another design to foil the plans of Jehovah,
from the Scriptual narrative of which the female r&ocirc;le is omitted.
In the Scriptural legend of Noah his wife is barely mentioned, and her
name is not given, but from an early period vague rumours to her
discredit floated about, and these gathered consistency in the Gnostic
legend that it was through her that Satan managed to get on board the
Ark, as is elsewhere related (<a href="#ch27">Part IV. chap.
xxvii</a>.), and was so enabled to resuscitate antediluvial violence in
the drunken curses of Noah. Satan did this by working upon both the
curiosity and jealousy of Noraita, the name assigned Noah&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>It has been necessary to give at length the comparative view of the
myth of Eden in order that the reader may estimate the grounds upon
which rests a theory which has been submitted after much hesitation
concerning its sense. The &lsquo;phallic&rsquo; theory by which it has
become the fashion to interpret so many of these old fables, appears to
me to have been done to death; yet I cannot come to any other
conclusion concerning the legend of Eve than that she represents that
passional nature of Woman which, before it was brought under such rigid
restraint, might easily be regarded as a weakness to any tribe desirous
of keeping itself separate from other tribes. The oath exacted by
Abraham <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>of his servant that he should seek out a wife from
among his own people, and not among Canaanitish women, is one example
among many of this feeling, which, indeed, survives among Jews at the
present day. Such a sentiment might underlie the stories of Eve and
Sara&mdash;the one mingling the blood of the family of Jehovah with
mere human flesh, the other nearly confusing it with aliens. As the
idea of tribal sanctity and separateness became strengthened by the
further development of theocratic government, such myths would take on
forms representing Jehovah&rsquo;s jealousy in defending his family
line against the evil powers which sought to confuse or destroy it. One
such attempt appears to underlie the story of the proposed sacrifice of
Isaac. Although the account we have of that proceeding in the Bible was
written at a time when the Elohist and Jahvist parties had compromised
their rivalries to some extent, and suggests the idea that Jehovah
himself ordered the sacrifice in order to try the faith of Abraham,
enough of the primitive tradition lingers in the narrative to make it
probable that its original intent was to relate how one of the
superseded Elohim endeavoured to tempt Abraham to sacrifice
Sara&rsquo;s only son, and so subvert the aim of Jehovah to perpetuate
his seed. The God who &lsquo;tempted Abraham&rsquo; is throughout
sharply distinguished from the Jehovah who sent his angel to prevent
the sacrifice and substitute an animal victim for Isaac.</p>
<p>Although, as we have seen, Sara was spared degradation into a
she-devil in subsequent myths, because her body was preserved intact
despite her laxity of mind, such was not the case with Eve. The silence
concerning her preserved throughout the Bible after her fall is told
was broken by the ancient rabbins, and there arose multitudinous
legends in which her intimacies with devils are circumstantially
reported. Her first child, Cain, was generally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>believed
to be the son of one of the devils (Sama&euml;l) that consorted with
her, and the world was said to be peopled with gnomes and demons which
she brought forth during that 130 years at the end of which it is
stated that Adam begot a son in his own image and likeness, and called
his name Seth (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%205:3&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
v. 3</a>). The previous children were supposed to be not in purely
human form, and not to have been of Adam&rsquo;s paternity. Adam had
during that time refused to have any children, knowing that he would
only rear inmates of hell.</p>
<p>The legend of Eden has gone round the world doing various duty, but
nearly always associated with the introduction of moral evil into the
world. In the Lateran Museum at Rome there is a remarkable bas-relief
representing a nude man and woman offering sacrifice before a serpent
coiled around a tree, while an angel overthrows the altar with his
foot. This was probably designed as a fling at the Ophites, and is very
interesting as a survival from the ancient Aryan meaning of the
Serpent. But since the adaptation of the myth by the Semitic race, it
has generally emphasised the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil,
instead of the Tree of Immortality (Amrita), which is the chief point
of interest in the Aryan myth. There are indeed traces of a conflict
with knowledge and scepticism in it which we shall have to consider
hereafter. The main popular association with it, the introduction into
the world of all the ills that flesh is heir to, is perfectly
consistent with the sense which has been attributed to its early Hebrew
form; for this includes the longing for maternity, its temptations and
its pains, and the sorrows and sins which are obviously traceable to
it.</p>
<p>Some years ago, when the spectacular drama of &lsquo;Paradise&rsquo;
was performed in Paris, the Temptation was effected by means of a
mirror. Satan glided behind the tree as a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>serpent, and then came
forth as a handsome man, and after uttering compliments that she could
not understand, presented Eve with a small oval mirror which explained
them all. Mlle. Abingdon as Eve displayed consummate art in her
expression of awakening self-admiration, of the longing for admiration
from the man before her, and the various stages of self-consciousness
by which she is brought under the Tempter&rsquo;s power. This idea of
the mirror was no doubt borrowed from the corresponding fable of
Pandora. On a vase (Etruscan) in the Hamilton Collection there is an
admirable representation of Pandora opening her box, from which all
evils are escaping. She is seated beneath a tree, around which a
serpent is coiled. Among the things which have come out of the box is
this same small oval mirror. In this variant, Hope, coming out last
corresponds with the prophecy that the seed of the woman shall bruise
the serpent&rsquo;s head. The ancient Etruscan and the modern Parisian
version are both by the mirror finely connected with the sexual sense
of the legend.</p>
<p>The theological interpretation of the beautiful myth of Eden
represents a sort of spiritual vivisection; yet even as a dogma the
story preserves high testimony: when woman falls the human race falls
with her; when man rises above his inward or outward degradations and
recovers his Paradise, it is because his nature is refined by the
purity of woman, and his home sweetened by her heart. There is a
widespread superstition that every Serpent will single out a woman from
any number of people for its attack. In such dim way is felt her gentle
bruising of man&rsquo;s reptilian self. No wonder that woman is
excluded from those regions of life where man&rsquo;s policy is still
to crawl, eat dust, and bite the heel.</p>
<p>It is, I suppose, the old Mystery of the Creation which left
Coventry its legend of a Good Eve (Godiva<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2402" title="Not in source">, whose name is written &lsquo;good
Eve&rsquo; in a Conventry verse, 1494</span>), whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>nakedness should bring benefit to man, as that of
the first Eve brought him evil. The fig-leaf of Eve, gathered no doubt
from the tree whose forbidden fruit she had eaten, has gradually grown
so large as to cloak her mind and spirit as well as her form. Her work
must still be chiefly that of a spirit veiled and ashamed. Her passions
suppressed, her genius disbelieved, her influence forced to seek hidden
and often illegitimate channels, Woman now outwardly represents a
creation of man to suit his own convenience. But the Serpent has also
changed a great deal since the days of Eve, and now, as Intelligence,
has found out man in his fool&rsquo;s-paradise, where he stolidly
maintains that, with few exceptions, it <i>is</i> good for man to be
alone. But good women are remembering Godiva; and realising that, the
charms which have sometimes lowered man or cost him dear may be made
his salvation. It shall be so when Woman can face with clear-eyed
purity all the facts of nature, can cast away the mental and moral
swathing-clothes transmitted from Eden, and put forth all her powers
for the welfare of mankind,&mdash;a Good Eva, whom Coventry Toms may
call naked, but who is &lsquo;not ashamed&rsquo; of the garb of
Innocence and Truth. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91"

Sara is concerned, lunar&mdash;aspects of the legend of Abraham, Sara,

which derives these personages from Aryan mythology. There seems to be
some reason for supposing that Sara is a semiticised form of
Sarany&uacute;. The two stand in somewhat the same typical position.
Sarany&uacute;, daughter of Tvashtar (&lsquo;the fashioner&rsquo;), was
mother of the first human pair, Yama and Yami. Sara is the first mother
of those born in a new (covenanted) creation. Each is for a time
concealed from mortals; each leaves her husband an illegitimate
representative. Sarany&uacute; gives her lord Savarn&aacute;

&lsquo;Man,&rsquo; but not the original perfect Man. Sara substitutes

<p class="first">The attempt of the compilers of the Book of Genesis to
amalgamate the Elohist and Jehovist legends, ignoring the moral abyss
that yawns between them, led to some sufficiently curious results. One
of these it may be well enough to examine here, since, though later in
form than some other legends which remain to be considered, it is
closely connected in spirit with the ancient myth of Eden and
illustrative of it.</p>
<p>The differences between the two creations of man and woman
critically examined in the previous chapter were fully recognised by
the ancient rabbins, and their speculations on the subject laid the
basis for the further legend that the woman created (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%201&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
i</a>.) at the same time with Adam, and therefore not possibly the
woman formed from his rib, was a first wife who turned out badly.</p>
<p>To this first wife of Adam it was but natural to assign the name of
one of the many ancient goddesses who had been degraded into
demonesses. For the history of Mariolatry in the North of Europe has
been many times anticipated: the mother&rsquo;s tenderness and
self-devotion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>the first smile of love upon social chaos, availed
to give every race its Madonna, whose popularity drew around her the
fatal favours of priestcraft, weighing her down at last to be a type of
corruption. Even the Semitic tribes, with their hard masculine deities,
seem to have once worshipped Alilat, whose name survives in Elohim and
Allah. Among these degraded Madonnas was Lilith, whose name has been
found in a Chaldean inscription, which says, when a country is at peace
&lsquo;Lilith (Lilatu) is not before them.&rsquo; The name is from
Assyr. <i>lay&rsquo;l&acirc;</i>, Hebrew <i>Lil</i> (night), which
already in Accadian meant &lsquo;sorcery.&rsquo; It probably
personified, at first, the darkness that soothed children to slumber;
and though the word <i>Lullaby</i> has, with more ingenuity than
accuracy, been derived from <i>Lilith Abi</i>, the theory may suggest
the path by which the soft Southern night came to mean a nocturnal
spectre.</p>
<p>The only place where the name of Lilith occurs in the Bible is
<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa%2034:14&amp;version=NRSV">
Isa. xxxiv. 14</a>, where the English version renders it
&lsquo;screech-owl.&rsquo; In the Vulgate it is translated
&lsquo;Lamia,&rsquo; and in Luther&rsquo;s Bible, &lsquo;Kobold;&rsquo;
Gesenius explains it as &lsquo;nocturna, night-spectre,
ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rabbinical myths concerning Lilith, often passed over as puerile
fancies, appear to me pregnant with significance and beauty. Thus
Abraham Ecchelensis, giving a poor Arabic version of the legend, says,
&lsquo;This fable has been transmitted to the Arabs from Jewish sources
by some converts of Mahomet from Cabbalism and Rabbinism, who have
transferred all the Jewish fooleries to the Arabs.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2450src" href="#xd26e2450" name="xd26e2450src">1</a>
But the rabbinical legend grew very slowly, and relates to principles
and facts of social evolution whose force and meaning are not yet
exhausted.</p>
<p>Premising that the legend is here pieced together mainly from
Eisenmenger,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2455src" href="#xd26e2455"
name="xd26e2455src">2</a> who at each mention of the subject
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>gives ample references to rabbinical authorities,
I will relate it without further references of my own.</p>
<p>Lilith was said to have been created at the same time and in the
same way as Adam; and when the two met they instantly quarrelled about
the headship which both claimed. Adam began the first conversation by
asserting that he was to be her master. Lilith replied that she had
equal right to be chief. Adam insisting, Lilith uttered a certain spell
called <i>Schem-hammphorasch</i>&mdash;afterwards confided by a fallen
angel to one of &lsquo;the daughters of men&rsquo; with whom he had an
intrigue, and of famous potency in Jewish folklore&mdash;the result of
which was that she obtained wings. Lilith then flew out of Eden and out
of sight.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2465src" href="#xd26e2465" name=
"xd26e2465src">3</a> Adam then cried in distress&mdash;&lsquo;Master of
the world, the woman whom thou didst give me has flown away.&rsquo; The
Creator then sent three angels to find Lilith and persuade her to
return to the garden; but she declared that it could be no paradise to
her if she was to be the servant of man. She remained hovering over the
Red Sea, where the angels had found her, while these returned with her
inflexible resolution. And she would not yield even after the angels
had been sent again to convey to her, as the alternative of not
returning, the doom that she should bear many children but these should
all die in infancy.</p>
<p>This penalty was so awful that Lilith was about to commit suicide by
drowning herself in the sea, when the three angels, moved by her
anguish, agreed that she should have the compensation of possessing
full power over all children after birth up to their eighth day; on
which she promised that she would never disturb any babes who were
under their (the angels&rsquo;) protection. Hence the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>charm
(Camea) against Lilith hung round the necks of Jewish children bore the
names of these three angels&mdash;Sen&oacute;i, Sansen&oacute;i, and
Sammangel&oacute;f. Lilith has special power over all children born out
of wedlock for whom she watches, dressed in finest raiment; and she has
especial power on the first day of the month, and on the Sabbath
evening. When a little child laughs in its sleep it was believed that
Lilith was with it, and the babe must be struck on the nose three
times, the words being thrice repeated&mdash;&lsquo;Away, cursed
Lilith! thou hast no place here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The divorce between Lilith and Adam being complete, the second Eve
(<i>i.e.</i>, Mother) was now formed, and this time out of Adam&rsquo;s
rib in order that there might be no question of her dependence, and
that the embarrassing question of woman&rsquo;s rights might never be
raised again.</p>
<p>But about this time the Devils were also created. These beings were
the last of the six days&rsquo; creation, but they were made so late in
the day that there was no daylight by which to fashion bodies for them.
The Creator was just putting them off with a promise that he would make
them bodies next day, when lo! the Sabbath&mdash;which was for a long
time personified&mdash;came and sat before him, to represent the many
evils which might result from the precedent he would set by working
even a little on the day whose sanctity had already been promulgated.
Under these circumstances the Creator told the Devils that they must
disperse and try to get bodies as they could find them. On this account
they have been compelled ever since to seek carnal enjoyments by
nestling in the hearts of human beings and availing themselves of human
senses and passions.</p>
<p>These Devils as created were ethereal spirits; they had certain
atmospheric forms, but felt that they had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>badly
treated in not having been provided with flesh and blood, and they were
envious of the carnal pleasures which human beings could enjoy. So long
as man and woman remained pure, the Devils could not take possession of
their bodies and enjoy such pleasures, and it was therefore of great
importance to them that the first human pair should be corrupted. At
the head of these Devils stood now a fallen angel&mdash;Sama&euml;l. Of
this archfiend more is said elsewhere; at this point it need only be
said that he had been an ideal flaming Serpent, leader of the Seraphim.
He was already burning with lust and envy, as he witnessed the
pleasures of Adam and Eve in Eden, when he found beautiful Lilith
lamenting her wrongs in loneliness.</p>
<p>She became his wife. The name of Sama&euml;l by one interpretation
signifies &lsquo;the Left&rsquo;; and we may suppose that Lilith found
him radical on the question of female equality which she had raised in
Eden. He gave her a splendid kingdom where she was attended by 480
troops; but all this could not compensate her for the loss of
Eden,&mdash;she seems never to have regretted parting with
Adam,&mdash;and for the loss of her children. She remained the Lady of
Sorrow. Her great enemy was Machalath who presided over 478 troops, and
who was for ever dancing, as Lilith was for ever sighing and weeping.
It was long believed that at certain times the voice of Lilith&rsquo;s
grief could be heard in the air.</p>
<p>Sama&euml;l found in Lilith a willing conspirator against Jehovah in
his plans for man and woman. The corruption of these two meant, to the
troops of Sama&euml;l, bringing their bodies down into a plane where
they might be entered by themselves (the Devils), not to mention at
present the manifold other motives by which they were actuated. It may
be remarked also that in the rabbinical <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>traditions, after their
Aryan impregnation, there are traces of a desire of the Devils to reach
the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>Truly a wondrous Tree! Around it, in its place at the east of Eden,
sang six hundred thousand lovely angels with happy hymns, and it
glorified the vast garden. It possessed five hundred thousand different
flavours and odours, which were wafted to the four sides of the world
by zephyrs from seven lustrous clouds that made its canopy. Beneath it
sat the disciples of Wisdom on resplendent seats, screened from the
blaze of sun, moon, and cloud-veiled from potency of the stars (there
was no night); and within were the joys referred to in the verse

</div>
<p>Had there been an order of female rabbins the story of Lilith might
have borne obvious modifications, and she might have appeared as a
heroine anxious to rescue her sex from slavery to man. As it is the
immemorial prerogative of man to lay all blame upon woman, that being
part of the hereditary following of Adam, it is not wonderful that
Lilith was in due time made responsible for the temptation of Eve. She
was supposed to have beguiled the Serpent on guard at the gate of Eden
to lend her his form for a time, after which theory the curse on the
serpent might mean the binding of Lilith for ever in that form. This
would appear to have originated the notion mentioned in Comestor (Hist.
Schol., 12th cent.), that while the serpent was yet erect it had a
virgin&rsquo;s head. The accompanying example is from a very early
missal in the possession of Sir Joseph Hooker, of which I could not
discover the date or history, but the theory <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>is
traceable in the eighth century. In this picture we have an early
example of those which have since become familiar in old Bibles. Pietro
d&rsquo;Orvieto painted this serpent-woman in his finest fresco, at
Pisa. Perhaps in no other picture has the genius of Mich&aelig;l Angelo
been more felicitous than in that on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,
in which Lilith is portrayed. In this picture (<a href="#fig02">Fig.
2</a>) the marvellous beauty of his first wife appears to have awakened
the enthusiasm of Adam; and, indeed, it is quite in harmony with the
earlier myth that Lilith should be of greater beauty than Eve.</p>

</div>
<p>An artist and poet of our own time (Rossetti) has by both of his
arts celebrated the fatal beauty of Lilith. His Lilith, bringing
&lsquo;soft sleep,&rsquo; antedates, as I think, the fair devil of the
Rabbins, but is also the medi&aelig;val witch against whose beautiful
locks Mephistopheles warns Faust when she appears at the
Walpurgis-night orgie.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The rose and poppy are her flowers; for where</p>
<p class="line">Is he not found, O Lilith, whom shed scent</p>
<p class="line">And soft-shed kisses and soft sleep shall snare?</p>
<p class="line">Lo! as that youth&rsquo;s eyes burned at thine, so
went</p>
<p class="line">Thy spell through him, and left his straight neck
bent,</p>
<p class="line">And round his heart one strangling golden hair.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>The potency of Lilith&rsquo;s tresses has probably its origin in the
hairy nature ascribed by the Rabbins to all demons (<i>shedim</i>), and
found fully represented in Esau. Perhaps the serpent-locks of Medusa
had a similar origin. Nay, there is a suggestion in Dante that these
tresses of Medusa may have once represented fascinating rather than
horrible serpents. As she approaches, Virgil is alarmed for his
brother-poet:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Turn thyself back, and keep thy vision hid;</p>
<p class="line">For, if the Gorgon show, and then behold,</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Twould all be o&rsquo;er with e&rsquo;er
returning up.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="line">So did the master say; and he himself</p>
<p class="line">Turned me, and to my own hands trusted not,</p>
<p class="line">But that with his too he should cover me.</p>
<p class="line">O you that have a sane intelligence,</p>
<p class="line">Look ye unto the doctrine which herein</p>
<p class="line">Conceals itself &rsquo;neath the strange verses&rsquo;
veil.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2562src" href="#xd26e2562" name=
"xd26e2562src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">If this means that the security against evil is to
veil the eyes from it, Virgil&rsquo;s warning would be against a
beautiful seducer, similar to the warning given by Mephistopheles to
Faust against the fatal charms of Lilith. Since, however, even in the
time of Homer, the Gorgon was a popular symbol of terrors, the
possibility of a survival in Dante&rsquo;s mind of any more primitive
association with Medusa is questionable. The Pauline doctrine, that the
glory of a woman is her hair, no doubt had important antecedents: such
glory might easily be degraded, and every hair turn to a fatal
&lsquo;binder,&rsquo; like the one golden thread of Lilith round the
heart of her victim; or it might ensnare its owner. In Treves Cathedral
there is a curious old picture of a woman carried to hell by her
beautiful hair; one devil draws her by it, another is seated on her
back and drives her by locks of it as a bridle.</p>
<p>In the later developments of the myth of Lilith she <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>was,
among the Arabs, transformed to a Ghoul, but in rabbinical legend she
appears to have been influenced by the story of Lamia, whose name is
substituted for Lilith in the Vulgate. Like Lilith, Lamia was robbed of
her children, and was driven by despair to avenge herself on all
children.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2571src" href="#xd26e2571" name=
"xd26e2571src">5</a> The name of Lamia was long used to frighten
Italian children, as that of Lilith was by Hebrew nurses.</p>
<p>It is possible that the part assigned to Lilith in the temptation of
Eve may have been suggested by ancient Egyptian sculptures, which
represent the Tree of Life in Amenti (Paradise) guarded by the
Serpent-goddess Nu. One of these in the British Museum represents the
Osirian on his journey to heaven, and his soul in form of a
human-headed bird, drinking the water of Life as poured out to them
from a jar by the goddess who coils around the sacred sycamore, her
woman&rsquo;s bust and face appearing amid the branches much like
Lilith in our old pictures.</p>
<p>The Singhalese also have a kind of Lilith or Lamia whom they call
Bodrima, though she is not so much dreaded for the sake of children as
for her vindictive feelings towards men. She is the ghost of a woman
who died in childbirth and in great agony. She may be heard wailing in
the night, it is said, and if she meets any man will choke him to
death. When her wailing is heard men are careful to stay within doors,
but the women go forth with brooms in their hands and abuse Bodrima
with epithets. She fears women, especially when they carry brooms. But
the women have also some compassion for this poor ghost, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>and
often leave a lamp and some betel leaves where she may get some warmth
and comfort from them. If Bodrima be fired at, there may be found,
perhaps, a dead lizard near the spot in the morning.</p>
<p>As protomartyr of female independence, Lilith suffered a fate not
unlike that of her sisters and successors in our own time who have
appealed from the legendary decision made in Eden: she became the
prototype of the &lsquo;strong-minded&rsquo; and
&lsquo;cold-hearted&rsquo; woman, and personification of the fatal
fascination of the passionless. Her special relation to children was
gradually expanded, and she was regarded as the perilous seducer of
young men, each of her victims perishing of unrequited passion. She was
ever young, and always dressed with great beauty. It would seem that
the curse upon her for forsaking Adam&mdash;that her children should
die in infancy&mdash;was escaped in the case of the children she had by
Sama&euml;l. She was almost as prolific as Echidna. Through all the
latter rabbinical lore it is repeated, &lsquo;Sama&euml;l is the fiery
serpent, Lilith the crooked serpent,&rsquo; and from their union came
Leviathan, Asmodeus, and indeed most of the famous devils.</p>
<p>There is an ancient Persian legend of the first man and woman,
Meschia and Meschiane, that they for a long time lived happily
together: they hunted together, and discovered fire, and made an axe,
and with it built them a hut. But no sooner had they thus set up
housekeeping than they fought terribly, and, after wounding each other,
parted. It is not said which remained ruler of the hut, but we learn
that after fifty years of divorce they were reunited.</p>
<p>These legends show the question of equality of the sexes to have
been a very serious one in early times. The story of Meschia and
Meschiane fairly represents primitive man living by the hunt; that of
Eden shows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>man entering on the work of agriculture. In
neither of these occupations would there be any reason why woman should
be so unequal as to set in motion the forces which have diminished her
physical stature and degraded her position. Women can still hunt and
fish, and they are quite man&rsquo;s equal in tilling the
soil.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2591src" href="#xd26e2591" name=
"xd26e2591src">6</a></p>
<p>In all sex-mythology there are intimations that women were taken
captive. The proclamation of female subordination is made not only in
the legend of Eve&rsquo;s creation out of the man&rsquo;s rib, but in
the emphasis with which her name is declared to have been given her
because she was the Mother of all living. In the variously significant
legends of the Amazons they are said to have burned away their breasts
that they might use the bow: in the history of contemporary
Amazons&mdash;such as the female Areoi of Polynesia&mdash;the legend is
interpreted in the systematic slaughter of their children. In the hunt,
Meschia might be aided by Meschiane in many ways; in dressing the
garden Adam might find Lilith or Eve a &lsquo;help meet&rsquo; for the
work; but in the brutal r&eacute;gime of war the child disables woman,
and the affections of maternity render her man&rsquo;s inferior in the
work of butchery. Herakles wins <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"
href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>great glory by slaying
Hyppolite; but the legends of her later reappearances&mdash;as Libussa
at Prague, &amp;c.,&mdash;follow the less mythological story of the
Amazons given by Herodotus (IV. 112), who represents the Scythians as
gradually disarming them by sending out their youths to meet them with
dalliance instead of with weapons. The youths went off with their
captured captors, and from their union sprang the Sauromat&aelig;,
among whom the men and women dressed alike, and fought and hunted
together. But of the real outcome of that truce and union Tennyson can
tell us more than Herodotus: in his <i>Princess</i> we see the woman
whom maternity and war have combined to produce, her independence
betrayed by the tenderness of her nature. The surrender, once secured,
was made permanent for ages by the sentiments and sympathies born of
the child&rsquo;s appeal for compassion.</p>
<p>In primitive ages the child must in many cases have been a burthen
even to man in the struggle for existence; the population question
could hardly have failed to press its importance upon men, as it does
even upon certain animals; and it would be an especial interest to a
man not to have his hut overrun with offspring not his
own,&mdash;turning his fair labour into drudgery for their support, and
so cursing the earth for him. Thus, while Polyandry was giving rise to
the obvious complications under which it must ultimately disappear, it
would be natural that devils of lust should be invented to restrain the
maternal instinct. But as time went on the daughters of Eve would have
taken the story of her fall and hardships too much to heart. The pangs
and perils of childbirth were ever-present monitors whose warnings
might be followed too closely. The early Jewish laws bear distinct
traces of the necessity which had arrived for insisting on the command
to increase and multiply. Under these changed circumstances
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>it would be natural that the story of a recusant
and passionless Eve should arise and suffer the penalties undergone by
Lilith,&mdash;the necessity of bearing, as captive, a vast progeny
against her will only to lose them again, and to long for human
children she did not bring forth and could not cherish. The too
passionate and the passionless woman are successively warned in the
origin and outcome of the myth.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2612src"
href="#xd26e2612" name="xd26e2612src">7</a></p>
<p>It is a suggestive fact that the descendants of Adam should trace
their fall not to the independent Lilith, who asserted her equality at
cost of becoming the Devil&rsquo;s bride, but to the apparently
submissive Eve who stayed inside the garden. The serpent found out the
guarded and restrained woman as well as the free and defiant, and with
much more formidable results. For craft is the only weapon of the weak
against the strong. The submissiveness of the captive woman must have
been for a long time outward only. When Adam found himself among thorns
and briars he might have questioned whether much had been gained by
calling Eve his rib, when after all she really was a woman, and
prepared to take her intellectual rights from the Serpent if denied her
in legitimate ways. The question is, indeed, hardly out of date yet
when the genius of woman is compelled to act with subtlety and reduced
to exert its influence too often by intrigue.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that we find something like a similar development
to the two wives of Adam in Hindu mythology also. K&aacute;li and
D&uacute;rga have the same origin: the former is represented dancing on
the prostrate form of her &lsquo;lord and master,&rsquo; and she
becomes the demoness of violence, the mother of the diabolical
&lsquo;Calas&rsquo; of Singhalese <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104"
href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>demonolatry. D&uacute;rga
sacrificed herself for her husband&rsquo;s honour, and is now adored.
The counterpart of D&uacute;rga-worship is the Zenana system. In
countries where the Zenana system has not survived, but some freedom
has been gained for woman, it is probable that K&aacute;li will
presently not be thought of as necessarily trampling on man, and Lilith
not be regarded as the Devil&rsquo;s wife because she will not submit
to be the slave of man. When man can make him a home and garden which
shall not be a prison, and in which knowledge is unforbidden fruit,
Lilith will not have to seek her liberty by revolution against his
society, nor Eve hers by intrigue; unfitness for co-operation with the
ferocities of nature will leave her a help meet for the rearing of
children, and for the recovery and culture of every garden, whether
within or without the man who now asserts over woman a lordship
unnatural and unjust. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=

martial and hunting customs of the German women, as well as their
equality with men, may be traced in the vestiges of their decline.
<i>Hexe</i> (witch) is from <i>hag</i> (forest): the priestesses who
carried the Broom of Thor were called Hagdissen. Before the seventeenth
century the Hexe was called Drud or Trud (red folk, related to the
Lightning-god). But the famous female hunters and warriors of Wodan,
the Valkyries, were so called also; and the preservation of the epithet
(Trud) in the noble name Gertrude is a connecting link between the
German Amazons and the political power so long maintained by women in
the same country. Their office as priestesses probably marks a step
downward from their outdoor equality. By this route, as priestesses of
diabolised deities, they became witches; but many folk-legends made
these witches still great riders, and the Devil was said to transform
and ride them as dapplegrey mares. The chief charge against the
witches, that of carnal commerce with devils, is also significant. Like
Lilith, women became devils&rsquo; brides whenever they were not
content with sitting at home with the distaff and the
child.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e2591src">&uarr;</a></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In none of the ancient scriptures do we get back to
any theory or explanation of the origin of evil or of the enemies of
the gods. In a Persian text at Persepolis, of Darius I., Ahriman is
called with simplicity &lsquo;the Other&rsquo; (<i>Aniya</i>), and
&lsquo;the Hater&rsquo; (<i>Duvaisa&ntilde;t</i>, Zend
<i>tha&#299;sat</i>), and that is about as much as we are really told
about the devils of any race. Their existence is taken for granted. The
legends of rebellion in heaven and of angels cast down and transformed
to devils may supply an easy explanation to our modern theologians, but
when we trace them to their origin we discover that to the ancients
they had no such significance. The angels were cast down to Pits
prepared for them from the foundation of the world, and before it, and
when they fell it was into the hands of already existing enemies eager
to torment them. Nevertheless these accounts of rebellious spirits in
heaven are of great importance and merit our careful consideration.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the Bible opens with an intimation of the
existence of this &lsquo;Other.&rsquo; Its second verse speaks of a
certain &lsquo;darkness upon the face of the deep.&rsquo; The word used
here is <i>Bohu</i>, which is identified as the Assyrian <i>Bahu</i>,
the Queen of Hades. In the inscription of Shalmaneser <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>the
word is used for &lsquo;abyss of chaos.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2653src" href="#xd26e2653" name="xd26e2653src">1</a> Bahu is
otherwise Gula, a form of Ishtar or Allat, &lsquo;Lady of the House of
Death,&rsquo; and an epithet of the same female demon is Nin-cigal,
&lsquo;Lady of the Mighty Earth.&rsquo; The story of the Descent of
Ishtar into Hades, the realm of Nin-cigal, has already been told (p.
77); in that version Ishtar is the same as Astarte, the Assyrian Venus.
But like the moon with which she was associated she waned and declined,
and the beautiful legend of her descent (like Persephone) into Hades
seems to have found a variant in the myth of Bel and the Dragon. There
she is a sea-monster and is called Tiamat (Thalatth of
Berosus),&mdash;that is, &lsquo;the Deep,&rsquo; over which rests the
darkness described in <a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%201:2&amp;version=NRSV">
Genesis i. 2</a>. The process by which the moon would share the evil
repute of Tiamat is obvious. In the Babylonian belief the dry land
rested upon the abyss of watery chaos from which it was drawn. This
underworld ocean was shut in by gates. They were opened when the moon
was created to rule the night&mdash;therefore Prince of Darkness. The
formation by Anu of this Moon-god (Uru) from Tiamat, might even have
been suggested by the rising of the tides under his sway. The
Babylonians represent the Moon as having been created before the Sun,
and he emerged from &lsquo;a boiling&rsquo; in the abyss. &lsquo;At the
beginning of the month, at the rising of the night, his horns are
breaking through to shine on heaven.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2660src" href="#xd26e2660" name="xd26e2660src">2</a> In the one
Babylonian design, a seal in the British Museum,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2663src" href="#xd26e2663" name="xd26e2663src">3</a> which seems
referable to the legend of the Fall of Man, the male figure has horns.
It may have been that this male Moon (Uru) was supposed to have been
corrupted by some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107"
name="pb107">107</a>]</span>female emanation of Tiamat, and to have
fallen from a &lsquo;ruler of the night&rsquo; to an ally of the night.
This female corrupter, who would correspond to Eve, might in this way
have become mistress of the Moon, and ultimately identified with
it.</p>
<p>Although the cause of the original conflict between the Abyss
beneath and the Heaven above is left by ancient inscriptions and
scriptures to imagination, it is not a very strained hypothesis that
ancient Chaos regarded the upper gods as aggressors on her domain in
the work of creation. &lsquo;When above,&rsquo; runs the Babylonian
legend, &lsquo;were not raised the heavens, and below on the earth a
plant had not grown &hellip; the chaos (or water) Tiamat was the
producing mother of the whole of them.&rsquo; &lsquo;The gods had not
sprung up, any one of them.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2670src"
href="#xd26e2670" name="xd26e2670src">4</a> Indeed in the legend of the
conflict between Bel and the Dragon, on the Babylonian cylinders, it
appears that the god Sar addressed her as wife, and said, &lsquo;The
tribute to thy maternity shall be forced upon them by thy
weapons.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2673src" href="#xd26e2673"
name="xd26e2673src">5</a> The Sun and Moon would naturally be drawn
into any contest between Overworld (with Light) and Underworld (with
Darkness).</p>
<p>Though Tiamat is called a Dragon, she was pictured by the
Babylonians only as a monstrous Griffin. In the Assyrian account of the
fight it will be seen that she is called a &lsquo;Serpent.&rsquo; The
link between the two&mdash;Griffin and Serpent&mdash;will be found, I
suspect, in Typhonic influence on the fable. In a hymn to Amen-Ra (the
Sun), copied about fourteenth century <span class="sc">b.c.</span> from
an earlier composition, as its translator, Mr. Goodwin, supposes, we
have the following:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The gods rejoice in his goodness who exalts those who
are lowly:</p>
<p class="line">Lord of the boat and barge,</p>
<p class="line">They conduct thee through the firmament in peace.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=

<p class="line xd26e2689">Thy servants rejoice:</p>
<p class="line">Beholding the overthrow of the wicked:</p>
<p class="line">His limbs pierced with the sword:</p>
<p class="line">Fire consumes him:</p>
<p class="line">His soul and body are annihilated.</p>
<p class="line xd26e2689"><span class="sc">Naka</span> (the serpent)
saves his feet:</p>
<p class="line">The gods rejoice:</p>
<p class="line">The servants of the Sun are in peace.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The allusion in the second line indicates that this
hymn relates to the navigation of Ra through Hades, and the destruction
of Apophis.</p>
<p>We may read next the Accadian tablet (p. 256) which speaks of the
seven Hathors as neither male nor female, and as born in &lsquo;the
Deep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another Accadian tablet, translated by Mr. Sayce, speaks of these as
the &lsquo;baleful seven destroyers;&rsquo; as &lsquo;born in the
mountain of the sunset;&rsquo; as being Incubi. It is significantly
said:&mdash;&lsquo;Among the stars of heaven their watch they kept not,
in watching was their office.&rsquo; Here is a prim&aelig;val note of

<p>At length we reach the brief but clear account of the &lsquo;Revolt

translated by Mr. Fox Talbot:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2992src" href=

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Divine Being spoke three times, the commencement of

<p class="line">The god of holy songs, Lord of religion and worship</p>

<p class="first">It will be observed that there were already hostile
gods to whom these riotous angels were sent. It is clear that in both
the Egyptian and Assyrian cosmogonies the upper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>gods
had in their employ many ferocious monsters. Thus in the Book of Hades,
Horus addresses a terrible serpent: &lsquo;My Kheti, great fire, of
which this flame in my eye is the emission, and of which my children
guard the folds, open thy mouth, draw wide thy jaws, launch thy flame
against the enemies of my father, burn their bodies, consume their
souls!<span class="corr" id="xd26e3029" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3031src"
href="#xd26e3031" name="xd26e3031src">12</a> Many such instances could
be quoted. In this same book we find a great serpent, Saa-Set,
&lsquo;Guardian of the Earth.&rsquo; Each of the twelve pylons of Hades
is surmounted by its serpent-guards&mdash;except one. What has become
of that one? In the last inscription but one, quoted in full, it will
be observed (third line from the last) that <i>eleven</i> (angel)
tribes came in after Bel&rsquo;s battle to inspect the slain dragon.
The twelfth had revolted. These, we may suppose, had listened to
&lsquo;the serpent&rsquo;s voice&rsquo; mentioned in the last fragment
quoted.</p>
<p>We have thus distributed through these fragments all the elements
which, from Egyptian and Assyrian sources gathered around the legend of
the Serpent in Eden. The Tree of Knowledge and that of Life are not
included, and I have given elsewhere my reasons for believing these to
be importations from the ancient Aryan legend of the war between the
Devas and Asuras for the immortalising Amrita.</p>
<p>In the last fragment quoted we have also a notable statement, that
mankind were created to fill the places that had been occupied by the
fallen angels. It is probable that this notion supplied the basis of a
class of legends of which Lilith is type. She whose place Eve was
created to fill was a serpent-woman, and the earliest mention of her is
in the exorcism already quoted, found at Nineveh. In all probability
she is but another form of Gula, the fallen Istar and Queen of Hades;
in which case her conspiracy with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>the serpent Sama&euml;l would
be the Darkness which was upon the face of Bahu, &lsquo;the
Deep,&rsquo; in the second verse of the Bible.</p>
<p>The Bible opens with the scene of the gods conquering the Dragon of
Darkness with Light. There is a rabbinical legend, that when Light
issued from under the throne of God, the Prince of Darkness asked the
Creator wherefore he had brought Light into existence? God answered
that it was in order that he might be driven back to his abode of
darkness. The evil one asked that he might see that; and entering the
stream of Light, he saw across time and the world, and beheld the face
of the Messiah. Then he fell upon his face and cried, &lsquo;This is he
who shall lay low in ruin me and all the inhabitants of
hell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>What the Prince of Darkness saw was the vision of a race: beginning
with the words (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=

Woe to the earth and the sea! for the devil is come down to you, having
great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.&rsquo;
This passage from the Book of Revelations is the refrain of many and
much earlier scriptures. The Assyrian accounts of the war in heaven,
given in the preceding chapter, by no means generally support the story
that the archdragon was slain by Bel. Even the one that does describe
the chief dragon&rsquo;s death leaves her comrades alive, and the
balance of testimony is largely in favour of the theory which
prevailed, that the rebellious angels were merely cast out of heaven,
and went to swell the ranks of the dark and fearful abode which from
the beginning had been peopled by the enemies of the gods. The nature
of this abode is described in various passages of the Bible, and in
many traditions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the
inhabitants of the land.&rsquo; So said Jeremiah (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jer%201:14&amp;version=NRSV">i.
14</a>), in pursuance of nearly universal traditions as to the region
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>space in which demons and devils had their
abode. &lsquo;Hell is naked before him,&rsquo; says Job (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job%2026:6&amp;version=NRSV">xxvi.
6</a>), &lsquo;and destruction hath no covering. He stretcheth out the
north over the empty place.&rsquo; According to the Hebrew mythology
this habitation of demons was a realm of perpetual cold and midnight,
which Jehovah, in creating the world, purposely left chaotic; so it was
prepared for the Devil and his angels at the foundation of the
world.</p>
<p>Although this northern hell was a region of disorder, so far as the
people of Jehovah and the divine domain were concerned, they had among
themselves a strong military and aristocratic government. It was
disorder perfectly systematised. The anarchical atmosphere of the
region is reflected in the abnormal structures ascribed to the many
devils with whose traits Jewish and Arabic folklore is familiar, and
which are too numerous to be described here. Such a devil, for
instance, is Bedargon, &lsquo;hand-high,&rsquo; with fifty heads and
fifty-six hearts, who cannot strike any one or be struck, instant death
ensuing to either party in such an attack. A more dangerous devil is
Ketef, identified as the &lsquo;terror from the chambers&rsquo; alluded
to by Jeremiah (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jer%2032:35&amp;version=NRSV">xxxii.
25</a>), &lsquo;Bitter Pestilence.&rsquo; His name is said to be from
<i>kataf</i>, &lsquo;cut and split,&rsquo; because he divides the
course of the day; and those who are interested to compare Hebrew and
Hindu myths may find it interesting to note the coincidences between
Ketef and Ketu, the cut-off tail of R&aacute;hu, and source of
pestilence.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3083src" href="#xd26e3083" name=
"xd26e3083src">1</a> Ketef reigns neither in the dark or day, but
between the two; his power over the year is limited to the time between
June 17 and July 9, during which it was considered dangerous to flog
children or let them go out after four <span class="sc">P.M.</span>
Ketef is calf-headed, and consists of hide, hair, and eyes; he rolls
like a cask; he has a terrible horn, but his chief <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>terror lies in an evil eye fixed in his heart
which none can see without instant death. The arch-fiend who reigns
over the infernal host has many Court Fools&mdash;probably meteors and
comets&mdash;who lead men astray.</p>
<p>All these devils have their regulations in their own domain, but, as
we have said, their laws mean disorder in that part of the universe
which belongs to the family of Jehovah. In flying about the world they
are limited to places which are still chaotic or waste. They haunt such
congenial spots as rocks and ruins, and frequent desert, wilderness,
dark mountains, and the ruins of human habitations. They can take
possession of a wandering star.</p>
<p>There is a pretty Talmudic legend of a devil having once gone to
sleep, when some one, not seeing him of course, set down a cask of wine
on his ears. In leaping up the devil broke the cask, and being tried
for it, was condemned to repay the damage at a certain period. The
period having elapsed before the money was brought, the devil was asked
the cause of the delay. He replied that it was very difficult for
devils to obtain money, because men were careful to keep it locked or
tied up; and &lsquo;we have no power,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to take
from anything bound or sealed up, nor can we take anything that is
measured or counted; we are permitted to take only what is free or
common.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to one legend the devils were specially angered, because
Jehovah, when he created man, gave him dominion over things in the sea
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%201:28&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
i. 28</a>), that being a realm of unrest and tempest which they claimed
as belonging to themselves. They were denied control of the life that
is in the sea, though permitted a large degree of power over its
waters. Over the winds their rule was supreme, and it was only by
reducing certain demons to slavery that Solomon was able to ride in a
wind-chariot.</p>
<p>Out of these several realms of order and disorder in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>nature were evolved the angels and the devils
which were supposed to beset man. The first man is said to have been
like an angel. From the instant of his creation there attended him two
spirits, whom the rabbins found shadowed out in the sentence,
&lsquo;Jehovah-Elohim formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul&rsquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%202:7&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
ii. 7</a>). This &lsquo;breath of life&rsquo; was a holy spirit, and
stood on Adam&rsquo;s right; the &lsquo;living soul&rsquo; was a
restless spirit on his left, which continually moved up and down. When
Adam had sinned, this restless spirit became a diabolical spirit, and
it has ever acted as mediator between man and the realm of anarchy.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned that in the Assyrian legends of the Revolt in
Heaven we find no adequate intimation of the motive by which the rebels
were actuated. It is said they interrupted the heavenly song, that they
brought on an eclipse, that they afflicted human beings with disease;
but why they did all this is not stated. The motive of the serpent in
tempting Eve is not stated in Genesis. The theory which C&aelig;dmon
and Milton have made so familiar, that the dragons aspired to rival
Jehovah, and usurp the throne of Heaven, must, however, have been
already popular in the time of Isaiah. In his rhapsody concerning the
fall of Babylon, he takes his rhetoric from the story of Bel and the
Dragon, and turns a legend, as familiar to every Babylonian as that of
St. George and the Dragon now is to Englishmen, into an illustration of
their own doom. The invective is directed against the King of Babylon,
consequently the sex of the devil is changed; but the most remarkable
change is in the ascription to Lucifer of a clear purpose to rival the
Most High, and seize the throne of heaven.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy
coming, it stirreth up the (spirits of) the dead, even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>all
the chief ones (great goats) of the earth: it hath raised up from their
thrones all the kings of the nations (demon-begotten aliens). All these
shall say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? Art thou become
like unto us? Thy splendour is brought down to the underworld, and the
noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
thee. How art thou fallen, O Lucifer (Daystar), son of the morning! how
art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations! For
thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into (the upper) heaven, I
will exalt my throne above the stars (archangels) of God: I will sit
(reign) also upon the mount of the congregation (the assembly of the
enemies of God) in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the
heights of the clouds (the thunder-throne of Jehovah); I will be like
the Most High. Yet shalt thou be brought down to hell, to the sides of
the pit.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3114src" href="#xd26e3114"
name="xd26e3114src">2</a></p>
<p>In this passage we mark the arena of the combat shifted from heaven
to earth. It is not the throne of heaven but that of the world at which
the fiends now aim. Nay, there is confession in every line of the
prophecy that the enemy of Jehovah <i>has</i> usurped his throne. Hell
has prevailed, and Lucifer is the Prince of this World. The celestial
success has not been maintained on earth. This would be the obvious
fact to a humiliated, oppressed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120"
href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>heavily-taxed people, who
believed themselves the one family on earth sprung from Jehovah, and
their masters the offspring of demons. This situation gave to the vague
traditions of a single combat between Bel and the Dragon, about an
eclipse or a riot, the significance which it retained ever afterward of
a mighty conflict on earth between the realms of Light and Darkness,
between which the Elohim had set a boundary-line (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%201:4&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
i. 4</a>) in the beginning.</p>
<p>A similar situation returned when the Jews were under the sway of
Rome, and then all that had ever been said of Babylon was repeated
against Rome under the name of Edom. It recurred in the case of those
Jews who acknowledged Jesus as their Messiah: in the pomp and glory of
the C&aelig;sars they beheld the triumph of the Powers of Darkness, and
the burthen of Isaiah against Lucifer was raised again in that of the
Apocalypse against the seven-headed Dragon. It is notable how these
writers left out of sight the myth of Eden so far as it did not belong
to their race. Isaiah does not say anything even of the serpent. The
Apocalypse says nothing of the two wonderful trees, and the serpent
appears only as a Dragon from whom the woman is escaping, by whom she
is not at all tempted. The shape of the Devil, and the Combat with him,
have always been determined by dangers and evils that are actual, not
such as are arch&aelig;ological. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>A gipsy near Edinburgh gave me his version of the combat between God
and Satan as follows. &lsquo;When God created the universe and all
things in it, Satan tried to create a rival universe. He managed to
match everything pretty well except man. There he failed; and God to
punish his pride cast him down to the earth and bound him with a chain.
But this chain was so long that Satan was able to move over the whole
face of the earth!&rsquo; There had got into this wanderer&rsquo;s head
some bit of the Babylonian story, and it was mingled with Gnostic
traditions about Ildabaoth; but there was also a quaint suggestion in
Satan&rsquo;s long chain of the migration of this mythical combat not
only round the world, but through the ages.</p>
<p>The early followers of Christ came before the glories of Paganism
with the legend that the lowly should inherit the earth. And though
they speedily surrendered to the rulers of the world in Rome, and made
themselves into a christian aristocracy, when they came into Northern
Europe the christians were again brought to confront with an humble
system the religion of thrones and warriors. St. Gatien celebrating
mass in a cavern beside the Loire, meant as much weakness in presence
of Paganism as the Huguenots felt twelve centuries later hiding in the
like caverns from St. Gatien&rsquo;s priestly successors.</p>
<p>The burthen of Isaiah is heard again, and with realistic intensity,
in the seventh century, and in the north, with our patriarchial poet
C&aelig;dmon.</p>

<p>Whether this spirited description was written by C&aelig;dmon, and
whether it is of his century, are questions unimportant to the present
inquiry. The poem represents a medi&aelig;val notion which long
prevailed, and which characterised the Mysteries, that Satan and his
comrades were humiliated from the highest angelic rank to a hell
already prepared and peopled with devils, and were there, and by those
devils, severely punished. One of the illuminations of the C&aelig;dmon
manuscript, preserved in the Bodleian Library, shows Satan undergoing
his torment (<a href="#fig03">Fig. 3</a>). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>He
is bound over something like a gridiron, and four devils are torturing
him, the largest using a scourge with six prongs. His face manifests
great suffering. His form is mainly human, but his bushy tail and
animal feet indicate that he has been transformed to a devil similar to
those who chastise him.</p>
<p>On C&aelig;dmon&rsquo;s foundation Milton built his gorgeous
edifice. His Satan is an ambitious and very English lord, in whom are
reflected the whole aristocracy of England in their hatred and contempt
of the holy Puritan Commonwealth, the Church of Christ as he deemed it.
The ages had brought round a similar situation to that which confronted
the Jews at Babylon, the early Christians of Rome, and their
missionaries among the proud pagan princes of the north. The Church had
long allied itself with the earlier Lucifers of the north, and now
represented the proud empire of a satanic aristocracy, and the
persecuted Nonconformists represented the authority of the King of
kings. In the English palace, and in the throne of Canterbury, Milton
saw his Beelzebub and his Satan.</p>

<p class="first">The Bel whom Milton saw was Cromwell, and the Dragon
that serpent of English oppression which the Dictator is trampling on
in a well-known engraving of his time. In the history of the
Reformation the old legend did manifold duty again, as in the picture
(<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>) by Luther&rsquo;s friend Lucas
Cranach.</p>
<p>It would seem that in the course of time Bel and the Dragon became
sufficiently close allies for their worshippers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>to
feed and defend them both with equal devotion, and for Daniel to
explode them both in carrying on the fight of his deity against the
gods of Babylon. This story of Bel is apocryphal as to the canon, but
highly significant as to the history we are now considering. Although
the Jews maintained their struggle against &lsquo;principalities and
powers&rsquo; long after it had been a forlorn hope, and never
surrendered, nor made alliance with the Dragon, the same cannot be said
of those who appropriated their title of &lsquo;the chosen of
God,&rsquo; counterfeited their covenant, and travestied their
traditions. The alliance of Christianity and the Dragon has not been
nominal, but fearfully real. In fulfilling their mission of
&lsquo;inheriting the earth,&rsquo; the &lsquo;meek&rsquo; called
around them and pressed into their service agents and weapons more
diabolical than any with which the Oriental imagination had peopled the
abode of devils in the north.</p>
<p>At a Fair in Tours (August 1878) I saw two exhibitions which were
impressive enough in the light they cast through history. One was a
shrunken and sufficiently grotesque production by puppets of the
Medi&aelig;val &lsquo;Mystery&rsquo; of Hell. Nearly every old scheme
and vision of the underworld was represented in the scene. The three
Judges sat to hear each case. A devil rang a bell whenever any culprit
appeared at the gate. The accused was ushered in by a winged
devil&mdash;Satan, the Accuser&mdash;who, by the show-woman&rsquo;s
lips, stated the charges against each with an eager desire to make him
or her out as wicked as possible. A devil with pitchfork received the
sentenced, and shoved them down into a furnace. There was an array of
brilliant dragons around, but they appeared to have nothing to do
beyond enjoying the spectacle. But this exhibition which was styled
&lsquo;Twenty minutes in Hell,&rsquo; was poor and faint beside the
neighbouring exhibition of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href=
"#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>the real Hell, in which Europe had
been tortured for fifteen centuries. Some industrious Germans had got
together in one large room several hundreds of the instruments of
torture by which the nations of the West were persuaded to embrace
Christianity. Every limb, sinew, feature, bone, and nerve of the human
frame had suggested to christian inventiveness some ingenious device by
which it might be tortured. Wheels on which to break bones, chairs of
anguish, thumbscrews, the iron Virgin whose embrace pierced through
every vital part; the hunger-mask which renewed for Christ&rsquo;s sake
the exact torment of Tantalus; even the machine which bore the very
name of the enemy that was cast down&mdash;the Dragon&rsquo;s Head! By
such instrumentalities came those quasi-miraculous &lsquo;Triumphs of
the Cross,&rsquo; of which so much has been said and sung! The most
salient phenomenon of christian history is the steady triumph of the
Dragon. Misleader and Deceiver to the last, he is quite willing to
sprinkle his fork and rack with holy water, to cross himself, to label
his caldrons &lsquo;divine justice,&rsquo; to write CHRIST upon his
forehead; by so doing he was able to spring his infernal engine on the
best nations, and cow the strongest hearts, till from their pallid lips
were wrung the &lsquo;confessions of faith,&rsquo; or the last cry of
martyred truth. So was he able to assault the pure heavens once more,
to quench the stars of human faith and hope, and generate a race of
polite, learned, and civilised hypocrites. But the ancient sunbeams are
after him: the mandate has again gone forth, &lsquo;Let there be
light,&rsquo; and the Light that now breaks forth is not of that kind
which respects the limit of Darkness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Isaiah xiv</a>. It may appear as if in this personification of a fallen
star we have entered a different mythological region from that
represented by the Assyrian tablets; but it is not so. The demoniac
forms of Ishtar, Astarte, are fallen stars also. She appears in Greece
as Artemis Astrateia, whose worship Pausanias mentions as coming from
the East. Her development is through Asteria (Greek form of Ishtar), in
whose myth is hidden much valuable Babylonian lore. Asteria was said to
have thrown herself into the sea, and been changed into the island
called Asteria, from its having fallen like a star from heaven. Her
suicide was to escape from the embraces of Zeus, and her escape from
him in form of a quail, as well as her fate, may be instructively
compared with the story of Lilith, who flew out of Eden on wings to
escape from Adam, and made an effort to drown herself in the Red Sea.
The diabolisation of Asteria (the fallen star) was through her daughter
Hecate. Hecate was the female Titan who was the most potent ally of the
gods. Her rule was supreme under Zeus, and all the gifts valued by
mortals were believed to proceed from her; but she was severely
judicial, and rigidly withheld all blessings from such as did not
deserve them. Thus she was, as the searching eye of Zeus, a star-spy
upon earth. Such spies, as we have repeatedly had occasion to mention
in this work, are normally developed into devils. From professional
detectives they become accusers and instigators. Ishtar of the
Babylonians, Asteria of the Greeks, and the Day-star of the Hebrews are
male and female forms of the same personification: Hecate with her
torch (<span class="trans" title="hekatos"><span class="Greek" lang=

<p class="first">This is the picture of the god of War. Upon it the

red. Sama&euml;l is red, also his horse, his sword, his raiment, and
the ground beneath him, are red. In the future the Holy God shall wear
his raiment.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3613src" href=
"#xd26e3613" name="xd26e3613src">2</a> Sama&euml;l is leader of the
Opposition. He is the Soul of the fiery planet Mars. He is the Creator
and inspirer of all Serpents. Azazel, demon of the Desert, is his First
Lord. He was the terrestrial Chief around whom the fallen angels
gathered, and his great power was acknowledged. All these characters
the ancient Rabbins found blended in his name. Simm&eacute; (dazzling),
S&oacute;me (blinding), Sem&oacute;l (the left side), and Samhammaveth
(deadly poison), were combined in the terrible name of Sama&euml;l. He
ruled over the <i>sinister</i> Left. When Moses, in war with the
Amalekites, raised his ten fingers, it was a special invocation to the
Ten Sephiroth, Divine Emanations, because he knew the power which the
Amalekites got from Sama&euml;l might turn his own left hand against
Israel.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3619src" href="#xd26e3619" name=
"xd26e3619src">3</a> The scapegoat was a sacrifice to him through
Azazel.</p>
<p>Sama&euml;l is the mythologic expression and embodiment of the
history of Esau, afterward Edom. Jacob and Esau represented the sheep
and the goat, divided in the past and to be sundered for ever. As Jacob
by covering his flesh with goat-skins obtained his father&rsquo;s
blessing due to Esau, the Israelites wandering through the wilderness
(near Edom&rsquo;s forbidden domain) seemed to have faith that the
offering of a goat would convince his Viceroy Azazel that they were
orthodox Edomites. The redness of Sama&euml;l begins with the red
pottage from which Esau was called Edom. The English version does not
give the emphasis with which Esau is said to have called for the
pottage&mdash;&ldquo;the red! the red!&rdquo; The characteristics
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>ascribed to Esau in the legend are merely a saga
built on the local names with which he was associated.
&lsquo;Edom&rsquo; means red, and &lsquo;Seir&rsquo; means hairy. It
probably meant the &lsquo;Shaggy Mountains.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3626src" href="#xd26e3626" name="xd26e3626src">4</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to observe the parting of the human and the
theological myths in this story. Jacob is the third person of a
patriarchal trinity,&mdash;Abraham the Heavenly Father, Isaac the
Laugher (the Sun), and Jacob the Impostor or Supplanter. As the moon
supplants the sun, takes hold of his heel, shines with his light, so
does Jacob supplant his elder brother; and all the deadliness ascribed
to the Moon, and other Third Persons of Trinities, was inherited by
Jacob until his name was changed by euphemism. As the impartial sun
shines for good and evil, the smile of Isaac, the Laugher, promised
great blessings to both of his sons. The human myth therefore
represents both of them gaining great power and wealth, and after a
long feud they are reconciled. This feature of the legend we shall
consider hereafter. Jehovah has another interest to be secured. He had
declared that one should serve the other; that they should be cursed
who cursed Jacob; and he said, &lsquo;Jacob have I loved, Esau have I
hated.&rsquo; Jahvistic theology had here something more important than
two brothers to harmonise; namely a patriarch&rsquo;s blessing and a
god&rsquo;s curse. It was contrary to all orthodoxy that a man whom
Jehovah hated should possess the blessings of life; it was equally
unorthodox that a father&rsquo;s blessing should not carry with it
every advantage promised. It had to be recorded that Esau became
powerful, lived by his sword, and had great possessions.</p>
<p>It had also to be recorded that &lsquo;Edom revolted from under the
hand of Judah and made a king unto themselves,&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>and
that such independence continued &lsquo;unto this day&rsquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2kings%208:20-22&amp;version=NRSV">2
Kings viii. 20, 22</a>). There was thus no room for the exhibition of
Jacob&rsquo;s superiority,&mdash;that is of Israel&rsquo;s priority
over Edom,&mdash;in this world; nor yet any room to carry out
Isaac&rsquo;s curse on all who cursed Jacob, and the saying:
&lsquo;Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated, and laid his mountains
and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness&rsquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=

i</a>.).</p>
<p>Answers to such problems as these evolve themselves slowly but
inevitably. The agonised cry of the poor girl in Browning&rsquo;s
poem&mdash;&lsquo;There may be heaven, there must be
hell&rsquo;&mdash;marks the direction in which necessity led human
speculation many ages before her. A future had to be invented for the
working out of the curse on Esau, who on earth had to fulfil his
father&rsquo;s blessing by enjoying power, wealth, and independence of
his brother. In that future his greatness while living was repaid by
his relegation to the desert and the rock with the he-goat for his
support. Esau was believed to have been changed into a terrible hairy
devil.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3643src" href="#xd26e3643" name=
"xd26e3643src">5</a> But still there followed him in his phantasmal
transformation a ghostly environment of his former power and greatness;
the boldest and holiest could not afford to despise or set aside that
&lsquo;share&rsquo; which had been allotted him in the legend, and
could not be wholly set aside in the invisible world.</p>
<p>Jacob&rsquo;s share began with a shrewd bargain with his imprudent
brother. Jacob by his cunning in the breeding of the streaked animals
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2030&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xxx</a>.), by which he outwitted Laban, and other man&oelig;uvres, was
really the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>cause of bringing on the race called after him
that repute for extortion, affixed to them in such figures as Shylock,
which they have found it so hard to live down. In becoming the great
barterers of the East, their obstacle was the plunderer sallying forth
from the mountain fastnesses or careering over the desert. These were
the traditional descendants of Esau, who gradually included the
Ishmaelites as well as the Edomites, afterwards merged in the Idumeans.
But as the tribal distinctions became lost, the ancient hostility
survived in the abstract form of this satan of
Strife&mdash;Sama&euml;l. He came to mean the spirit that stirs up
antagonism between those who should be brethren. He finally became, and
among the more superstitious Jews still is, instigator of the cruel
persecutions which have so long pursued their race, and the prejudices
against them which survive even in countries to whose wealth, learning,
and arts they have largely contributed. In Jewish countries Edom has
long been a name for the power of Rome and Romanism, somewhat in the
same way as the same are called &lsquo;Babylon&rsquo; by some
christians. Jacob, when passing into the wilderness of Edom, wrestled
with the invisible power of Esau, or Sama&euml;l, and had not been able
to prevail except with a lame thigh,&mdash;a part which, in every
animal, Israel thereafter held sacred to the Opposing Power and
abstained from eating. A rabbinical legend represents Jacob as having
been bitten by a serpent while he was lingering about the boundary of
Edom, and before his gift of goats and other cattle had been offered to
his brother. The fiery serpents which afflicted Israel were universally
attributed to Sama&euml;l, and the raising of the Brazen Serpent for
the homage of the people was an instance of the uniform deference to
Esau&rsquo;s power in his own domain which was long inculcated.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>As I write, fiery Mars, near enough for the astronomer to detect its
moons, is a wondrous phenomenon in the sky. Beneath it fearful famine
is desolating three vast countries, war is raging between two powerful
nations, and civil strife is smiting another ere it has fairly
recovered from the wounds of a foreign struggle. The dismal conditions
seem to have so little root in political necessity that one might
almost be pardoned even now for dreaming that some subtle influence has
come among men from the red planet that has approached the earth. How
easy then must it have been in a similar conjunction of earthly and
celestial phenomena to have imagined Sama&euml;l, the planetary
Spectre, to be at work with his fatal fires! Whatever may have been the
occasion, the red light of Mars at an early period fixed upon that
planet the odium of all the burning, blighting, desert-producing powers
of which it was thought necessary to relieve the adorable Sun. It was
believed that all &lsquo;born under&rsquo; that planet were
quarrelsome. And it was part of the popular Jewish belief in the
ultimate triumph of good over evil that under Mars the Messias was to
be born.</p>
<p>We may regard Esau-Sama&euml;l then as the Devil of Strife. His
traditional son Cain was like himself a &lsquo;murderer from the
beginning;&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3662src" href="#xd26e3662"
name="xd26e3662src">6</a> but in that early period the conflict was
between the nomad and the huntsman on one side, on the other the
agriculturist and the cattle-breeder, who was never regarded as a noble
figure among the Semitic tribes. In the course of time some Semitic
tribes became agriculturists, and among them, in defiance of his
arch&aelig;ological character, Sama&euml;l was saddled with the evils
that beset them. As an ox he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
"#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>brought rinderpest. But his
visible appearance was still more generally that of the raven, the wild
ass, the hog which brought scurvy; while in shape of a dog he was so
generally believed to bring deadly disease, that it would seem as if
&lsquo;hydrophobia&rsquo; was specially attributed to him.</p>
<p>In process of time benignant Peace dwelt more and more with the
agriculturists, but still among the Israelites the tradesman was the
&lsquo;coming man,&rsquo; and to him peace was essential. The huntsman,
of the Esau clan, figures in many legends, of which the following is
translated from the Arabic by Lane:&mdash;There was a huntsman who from
a mountain cave brought some honey in his water-skin, which he offered
to an oilman; when the oilman opened the skin a drop of honey fell
which a bird ate; the oilman&rsquo;s cat sprang on the bird and killed
it; the huntsman&rsquo;s hound killed the cat; the oilman killed the
dog; the huntsman killed the oilman; and as the two men belonged to
different villages, their inhabitants rose against each other in
battle, &lsquo;and there died of them a great multitude, the number of
whom none knoweth but God, whose name be exalted!&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3669src" href="#xd26e3669" name=
"xd26e3669src">7</a></p>
<p>Esau&rsquo;s character as a wild huntsman is referred to in another
chapter. It is as the genius of strife and nomadic war that he more
directly stands in contrast with his &lsquo;supplanter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>From the wild elemental demons of storm and tempest of the most
primitive age to this Devil of Strife, the human mind has associated
evil with unrest. &lsquo;The wicked are like the troubled sea when it
cannot rest.&rsquo; Such is the burthen of the Japanese Oni throned in
the heart of the hurricane, of the wild huntsman issuing forth at the
first note of war, of Edom hating the victories <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>of
peace, living by the sword. The prophecy that the Prince of Peace
should be born under the planet Mars is a strange and mystical
suggestion. In a powerful poem by Thomas Aird, &lsquo;The Devil&rsquo;s
Dream,&rsquo; the last fearful doom of Satan&rsquo;s vision is
imprisonment beneath a lake for ever still,&mdash;the Spirit of Unrest
condemned for ever to the realm of absolute stillness!</p>

<p class="first">In the preceding chapter it was noted that there were
two myths wrapped up in the story of Jacob and Esau,&mdash;the one
theological, the other human. The former was there treated, the latter
may be considered here. Rabbinical theology has made the Jewish race
adopt as their founder that tricky patriarch whom Shylock adopted as
his model; but any censure on them for that comes with little grace
from christians who believe that they are still enjoying a covenant
which Jacob&rsquo;s extortions and treacheries were the
divinely-adopted means of confirming. It is high time that the Jewish
people should repudiate Jacob&rsquo;s proceedings, and if they do not
give him his first name (&lsquo;Impostor&rsquo;) back again, at least
withdraw from him the name Israel. But it is still more important for
mankind to study the phases of their civilisation, and not attribute to
any particular race the spirit of a legend which represents an epoch of
social development throughout the world.</p>
<p>When Rebekah asked Jehovah why her unborn babes struggled in her
womb, he answered, &lsquo;Two nations are in thy womb. One people shall
be stronger than the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span>other people; the elder shall be subject to
the younger.&rsquo; What peoples these were is described in the
blessings of Jacob on the two representatives when they had grown up to
be, the one red and hairy, a huntsman; the other a quiet man, dwelling
in tents and builder of cattle-booths.</p>
<p>Jacob&mdash;cunning, extortionate, fraudulent in spirit even when
technically fair&mdash;is not a pleasing figure in the eyes of the
nineteenth century. But he does not belong to the nineteenth century.
His contest was with Esau. The very names of them belong to mythology;
they are not individual men; they are conflicting tendencies and
interests of a primitive period. They must be thought of as Israel and
Edom historically; morally, as the Barter principle and the Bandit
principle.</p>
<p>High things begin low. Astronomy began as Astrology; and when Trade
began there must have been even more trickery about it than there is
now. Conceive of a world made up of nomadic tribes engaged in perpetual
warfare. It is a commerce of killing. If a tribe desires the richer
soil or larger possessions of another, the method is to exterminate
that other. But at last there rises a tribe either too weak or too
peaceful to exterminate, and it proposes to barter. It challenges its
neighbours to a contest of wits. They try to get the advantage of each
other in bargains; they haggle and cheat; and it is not heroic at all,
but it is the beginning of commerce and peace.</p>
<p>But the Dukes of Edom as they are called will not enter into this
compact. They have not been used to it; they are always outwitted at a
bargain; just like those other red men in the West of America, whose
lands are bought with beads, and their territorial birthright taken for
a mess of pottage. They prefer to live by the hunt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>and
by the sword. Then between these two peoples is an eternal feud, with
an occasional truce, or, in biblical phrase,
&lsquo;reconciliation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surrounded by a commercial civilisation, with its prosaic virtues
and its petty vices, we cannot help admiring much about the Duke of
Edom, non-producer though he be. Brave, impulsive, quick to forgive as
to resent; generous, as people can afford to be when they may give what
they never earned; his gallant qualities cast a certain meanness over
his grasping brother, the Israelite. It is a healthy sign in youth to
admire such qualities. The boy who delights in Robin Hood; the youth
who feels a stir of enthusiasm when he reads Schiller&rsquo;s
<i>Robbers</i>; the <i>ennuy&eacute;s</i> of the clubs and the roughs,
with unfulfilled capacities for adventure in them, who admire
&lsquo;the gallant Turk,&rsquo; are all lingering in the nomadic age.
They do not think of things but of persons. They are impressed by the
barbaric dash. The splendour of warriors hides trampled and decimated
peasantries; their courage can gild atrocities. Beside such captivating
qualities and thrilling scenes how poor and commonplace appear thrifty
rusticity, and the cautious, selfish, money-making tradesmen!</p>
<p>But fine and heroic as the Duke of Edom may appear in the distance,
it is best to keep him at a distance. When Robin Hood reappeared on
Blackheath lately, his warmest admirers were satisfied to hear he was
securely lodged in gaol. The Jews had just the same sensations about
the Dukes of Edom. They saw that tribe near to, and lived in daily
dread of them. They were hirsute barbarians, dwelling amid mountain
fastnesses, and lording it over a vast territory. The weak tribe of the
plains had no sooner got together some herds and a little money, than
those dashing Edomites fell upon them and carried away their savings
and substance in a day. This made <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141"
href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>the bartering tribe all the
more dependent on their cunning. They had to match their wits against,
the world; and they have had to do the same to this day, when it is a
chief element of their survival that their thrift is of importance to
the business and finance of Europe. But in the myth it is shown that
Trade, timorous as it is in presence of the sword, may have a
magnanimity of its own. The Supplanter of Edom is haunted by the wrong
he has done his elder brother, and driven him to greater animosity. He
resolves to seek him, offer him gifts, and crave reconciliation. It is
easy to put an unfavourable construction upon his action, but it is not
necessary. The Supplanter, with droves of cattle, a large portion of
his possessions, passes out towards perilous Edom, unarmed, undefended,
except by his amicable intentions towards the powerful chieftain he had
wronged. At the border of the hostile kingdom he learns that the
chieftain is coming to meet him with four hundred men. He is now
seized, with a mighty spirit of Fear. He sends on the herdsmen with the
herds, and remains alone. During the watches of the night there closes
upon him this phantom of Fear, with its presage of Death. The tricky
tradesman has met his Conscience, and it is girt about with Terror. But
he feels that his nobler self is with it, and that he will win. Finely
has Charles Wesley told the story in his hymn:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Come, O thou traveller unknown,</p>
<p class="line">Whom still I hold but cannot see!</p>
<p class="line">My company before is gone</p>
<p class="line">And I am left alone with thee:</p>
<p class="line">With thee all night I mean to stay</p>
<p class="line">And wrestle till the break of day.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&lsquo;Confident in self-despair,&rsquo; the
Supplanter conquers his Fear; with the dawn he travels onward alone to
meet the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>man he had outraged and his armed men, and to
him says, &lsquo;I have appeared before thee as though I had appeared
before God, that thou mightest be favourable to me.&rsquo; The proud
Duke is disarmed. The brothers embrace and weep together. The chieftain
declines the presents, and is only induced to accept them as proof of
his forgiveness. The Tradesman learns for all time that his mere
cleverness may bring a demon to his side in the night, and that he
never made so good a bargain as when he has restored ill-gotten gains.
The aristocrat and warrior returns to his mountain, aware now that
magnanimity and courage are not impossible to quiet men living by
merchandise. The hunting-ground must make way now for the
cattle-breeder. The sword must yield before the balances.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the tribes which in primitive times had these
encounters, and taught each other this lesson, they were long since
reconciled. But the ghosts of Israel and Edom, of Barter and Plunder,
fought on through long tribal histories. Israel represented by the
archangel Michael, and Edom by dragon Sama&euml;l, waged their war. One
characteristic of the opposing power has been already considered.
Sama&euml;l embodied Edom as the genius of Strife. He was the especial
Accuser of Israel, their Antichrist, so to say, as Michael was their
Advocate. But the name &lsquo;Edom&rsquo; itself was retained as a kind
of personification of the barbaric military and lordly Devil. The
highwayman in epaulettes, the heroic spoiler, with his hairy hand which
Israel itself had imitated many a time in its gloves, were summed up as
&lsquo;Edom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This personification is the more important since it has
characterised the more serious idea of Satan which prevails in the
world. He is mainly a moral conception, and means the pride and pomp of
the world, its natural wildness and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>ferocities, and the
glory of them. The Mussulman fable relates that when Allah created man,
and placed him in a garden, he called all the angels to worship this
crowning work of his hands. Iblis alone refused to worship Adam. The
very idea of a garden is hateful to the spirit of Nomadism.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3790src" href="#xd26e3790" name="xd26e3790src">1</a>
Man the gardener receives no reverence from the proud leader of the
Seraphim. God said unto him (Iblis), What hindered thee from
worshipping Adam, since I commanded thee? He answered, I am more
excellent than he: thou hast created me of (ethereal) fire, and hast
created him of clay (black mud). God said, Get thee down therefore from
paradise, for it is not fit that thou behave thyself proudly
therein.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3796src" href="#xd26e3796" name=

</div>
<p>The earnestness and self-devotion of the northern pagans in their
resistance to Christianity impressed the finest minds in the Church
profoundly. Some of the Fathers even quoted the enthusiasm of those
whom they regarded as devotees of the Devil, to shame the apathy of
christians. The Church could show no martyr braver than Rand, down
whose throat St. Olaf made a viper creep, which gnawed through his
side; and Rand was an example of thousands. This gave many of the early
christians of the north a very serious view of the realm of Satan, and
of Satan himself as a great potentate. It was increased by their
discovery that the pagan kings&mdash;Satan&rsquo;s subjects&mdash;had
moral codes and law-courts, and energetically maintained justice. In
this way there grew up a more dignified idea of Hell. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>grotesque imps receded before the array of
majestic devils, like Satan and Beelzebub; and these were invested with
a certain grandeur and barbaric pride. They were regarded as rival
monarchs who had refused to submit themselves to Jehovah, but they were
deemed worthy of heroic treatment. The traces of this sentiment found
in the ancient frescoes of Russia are of especial importance. Nothing
can exceed the grandeur of the Hierarchy of Hell as they appear in some
of these superb pictures. Satan is generally depicted with similar
dignity to the king of heaven, from whom he is divided by a
wall&rsquo;s depth, sometimes even resembling him in all but complexion
and hair (which is fire on Satan). There are frequent instances, as in
the accompanying figure (<a href="#fig04">4</a>), where, in careful
correspondence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>with the attitude of Christ on the
Father&rsquo;s knees, Satan supports the betrayer of Christ. Beside the
king of Hell, seated in its Mouth, are personages of distinction, some
probably representing those poets and sages of Greece and Rome, the
prospect of whose damnation filled some of the first christian Fathers
with such delight.</p>
<p>In Spain, when a Bishop is about to baptize one of the European
Dukes of the Devil, he asks at the font what has become of his
ancestors, naming them&mdash;all heathen. &lsquo;They are all in
hell!&rsquo; replies the Bishop. &lsquo;Then there will I follow
them,&rsquo; returns the Chief, and thereafter by no persuasion can he
be induced to fare otherwise than to Hell. Gradually the Church made up
its mind to ally itself with this obstinate barbaric pride and
ambition. It was willing to give up anything whatever for a kingdom of
this world, and to worship any number of Princes of Darkness, if they
would give unto the Bishops such kingdoms, and the glory of them. They
induced Esau to be baptized by promise of their aid in his oppressions,
and free indulgences to all his passions; and then, by his help, they
were able to lay before weaker Esaus the christian
alternatives&mdash;Be baptized or burnt!</p>
<p>Not to have known how to conquer in bloodless victories the barbaric
Esaus of the world by a virtue more pure, a heroism more patient, than
theirs, and with that &lsquo;sweet reasonableness of Christ,&rsquo;
which is the latest epitaph on his tomb among the rich; not to have
recognised the true nobility of the Dukes, and purified their pride to
self-reverence, their passion to moral courage, their daring and
freedom to a self-reliance at once gentle and manly; this was no doubt
the necessary failure of a dogmatic and irrational system. But it is
this which has made the christian Israel more of an impostor than its
prototype, in every country to which it came steadily developing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>to a hypocritical imitator of the Esau whose
birthright it stole by baptism. It speedily lost his magnanimity, but
never his sword, which however it contrived to make at once meaner and
more cruel by twisting it into thumbscrews and the like. For many
centuries its voice has been, in a thin phonographic way, the voice of
Jesus, but the hands are the hands of Esau with Sama&euml;l&rsquo;s
claw added. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These words of the prophet Hosea (x. 1, 2) foreshadow
the devil which the devout Jahvist saw growing steadily to enormous
strength through all the history of Israel. The germ of this enemy may
be found in our chapter on Fate; one of its earliest developments is
indicated in the account already given of the partition between Jacob
and Esau, and the superstition to which that led of a ghostly
Antagonist, to whom a share had been irreversibly pledged. From the
principle thus adopted, there grew a host of demons whom it was
believed necessary to propitiate by offering them their share. A
divided universe had for its counterpart a divided loyalty in the heart
of the people. The growth of a belief in the supremacy of one God was
far from being a real monotheism; as a matter of fact no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>primitive race has been monotheistic. In 2 Kings
xvii. it is stated as a belief of the Jews that some Assyrians who had
been imported into their territory (Samaria) were slain by lions
because they knew not &lsquo;the manner of the God of the land.&rsquo;
Spinoza noticed the indications given in this and other narratives that
the Jews believed that gods whose worship was intolerable within their
own boundaries were yet adapted to other regions (Tractatus, ii.). With
this state of mind it is not wonderful that when the Jews found
themselves in those alien regions they apprehended that the gods of
those countries might also employ lions on such as knew not their
manner, but adhered to the worship of Jehovah too exclusively.</p>
<p>Among the Jews grew up a more spiritual class of minds, whose
feeling towards the mongrel worship around them was that of abhorrence;
but these had a very difficult cause to maintain. The popular
superstitions were firmly rooted in the fact that terrible evils
afflicted mankind, and in the further fact that these did not spare the
most pious. Nay, it had for a long time been a growing belief that the
bounties and afflictions of nature, instead of following the direction
promised by the patriarchs,&mdash;rewarding the pious, punishing the
wicked,&mdash;were distributed in a reverse way. Dives and Lazarus
seemed to have their respective lots before any future paradise was
devised for their equalisation&mdash;as indeed is natural, since Dives
attends to his business, while Lazarus is investing his powers in
Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. Out of this experience there came at last the
demand for a life beyond the grave, without whose redress the pious
began to deem themselves of all men the most miserable. But before this
heavenly future became a matter of common belief, there were theories
which prepared, the way for it. It was held by the devout that the
evils which afflicted the righteous were Jehovah&rsquo;s tests of their
loyalty to him, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149"
name="pb149">149</a>]</span>that in the end such trials would be
repaid. And when observation, following the theory, showed that they
were not so repaid, it was said the righteousness had been unreal, the
devotee was punished for hidden wickedness. When continued observation
had proved that this theory too was false, and that piety was not paid
in external bounties, either to the good man or his family, the
solution of a future settlement was arrived at.</p>
<p>This simple process may be traced in various races, and in its
several phases.</p>
<p>The most impressive presentation of the experiences under which the
primitive secular theory of rewards and punishments perished, and that
of an adjustment beyond the grave arose, is found in the Book of Job.
The solution here reached&mdash;a future reward in this life&mdash;is
an impossible one for anything more than an exceptional case. But the
Book of Job displays how beautiful such an instance would be, showing
afflictions to be temporary and destined to be followed by
compensations largely outweighing them. It was a tremendous statement
of the question&mdash;If a man die, shall he live again? Jehovah
answered, &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; out of the whirlwind, and raised Job out of
the dust. But for the millions who never rose from the dust that voice
was heard announcing their resurrection from a trial that pressed them
even into the grave. It is remarkable that Job&rsquo;s expression of
faith that his Vindicator would appear on earth, should have become the
one text of the Old Testament which has been adapted by christians to
express faith in immortality. Job strongly disowns that faith.</p>

<p class="first">The scenery and details of this drama are such as must
have made an impression upon the mind of the ancient Jews beyond what
is now possible for any existing people. In the first place, the
locality was the land of Uz, which Jeremiah (<a class="biblink xd26e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=lam%204:21&amp;version=NRSV">Lam.
iv. 21</a>) points out as part of Edom, the territory traditionally
ruled over by the great invisible Accuser of Israel, who had succeeded
to the portion of Esau, adversary of their founder, Jacob. Job was
within the perilous bounds. And yet here, where scape-goats were
offered to deprecate Sama&euml;l, and where in ordinary sacrifices some
item entered for the devil&rsquo;s share, Job refused to pay any honour
to the Power of the Place. He offered burnt-offerings alone for himself
and his sons, these being exclusively given to Jehovah.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3906src" href="#xd26e3906" name="xd26e3906src">2</a>
Even after his children and his possessions were destroyed by this
great adversary, Job offered his sacrifice without even omitting the
salt, which was the Oriental seal of an inviolable compact between two,
and which so especially recalled and consecrated the covenant with
Jehovah.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3909src" href="#xd26e3909" name=
"xd26e3909src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151"
name="pb151">151</a>]</span>Among his twenty thousand animals,
Azazel&rsquo;s animal, the goat, is not even named. Job&rsquo;s
distinction was an absolute and unprecedented singleness of loyalty to
Jehovah.</p>
<p>This loyalty of a disciple even in the enemy&rsquo;s country is made
the subject of a sort of boast by Jehovah when the Accuser enters.
Postponing for the moment consideration of the character and office of
this Satan, we may observe here that the trial which he challenges is
merely a test of the sincerity of Job&rsquo;s allegiance to Jehovah.
The Accuser claims that it is all given for value received. These
possessions are taken away.</p>
<p>This is but the framework around the philosophical poem in which all
theories of the world are personified in grand council.</p>
<p>First of all Job (the Troubled) asks&mdash;Why? Orthodoxy answers.
(Eliphaz was the son of Esau (Sama&euml;l), and his name here means
that he was the Accuser in disguise. He, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s
strength,&rsquo; stands for the Law. It affirms that God&rsquo;s ways
are just, and consequently afflictions imply previous sin.) Eliphaz
repeats the question put by the Accuser in heaven&mdash;&lsquo;Was not
thy fear of God thy hope?&rsquo; And he brings Job to the test of
prayer, in which he has so long trusted. Eliphaz rests on revelation;
he has had a vision; and if his revelation be not true, he challenges
Job to disprove it by calling on God to answer him, or else securing
the advocacy of some one of the heavenly host. Eliphaz says trouble
does not spring out of the dust. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"
href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s reply is to man and God&mdash;Point out the error! Grant
my troubles are divine arrows, what have I done to thee, O watcher of
men! Am I a sea-monster&mdash;and we imagine Job looking at his wasted
limbs&mdash;that the Almighty must take precautions and send spies
against me?</p>
<p>Then follows Bildad the Shuhite,&mdash;that is the
&lsquo;contentious,&rsquo; one of the descendants of Keturah
(Abraham&rsquo;s concubine), traditionally supposed to be inimical to
the legitimate Abrahamic line, and at a later period identified as the
Turks. Bildad, with invective rather than argument, charges that
Job&rsquo;s children had been slain for their sins, and otherwise makes
a personal application of Eliphaz&rsquo;s theology.</p>
<p>Job declares that since God is so perfect, no man by such standard
could be proved just; that if he could prove himself just, the argument
would be settled by the stronger party in his own favour; and
therefore, liberated from all temptation to justify himself, he affirms
that the innocent and the guilty are dealt with much in the same way.
If it is a trial of strength between God and himself, he yields. If it
is a matter of reasoning, let the terrors be withdrawn, and he will
then be able to answer calmly. For the present, even if he were
righteous, he dare not lift up his head to so assert, while the rod is
upon him.</p>
<p>Zophar &lsquo;the impudent&rsquo; speaks. Here too, probably, is a
disguise: he is (says the LXX.) King of the Min&aelig;ans, that is the
Nomades, and his designation &lsquo;the Naamathite,&rsquo; of unknown
significance, bears a suspicious resemblance to Naamah, a mythologic
wife of Sama&euml;l and mother of several devils. Zophar is cynical. He
laughs at Job for even suggesting the notion of an argument between
himself and God, whose wisdom and ways are unsearchable. He (God) sees
man&rsquo;s iniquity even when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153"
href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>it looks as if he did not. He
is deeper than hell. What can a man do but pray and acknowledge his
sinfulness?</p>
<p>But Job, even in his extremity, is healthy-hearted enough to laugh
too. He tells his three &lsquo;comforters&rsquo; that no doubt Wisdom
will die with them. Nevertheless, he has heard similar remarks before,
and he is not prepared to renounce his conscience and common-sense on
such grounds. And now, indeed, Job rises to a higher strain. He has
made up his mind that after what has come upon him, he cares not if
more be added, and challenges the universe to name his offence. So long
as his transgression is &lsquo;sealed up in a bag,&rsquo; he has a
right to consider it an invention.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3965src"
href="#xd26e3965" name="xd26e3965src">4</a></p>
<p>Temanite Orthodoxy is shocked at all this. Eliphaz declares that
Job&rsquo;s assertion that innocent and guilty suffer alike makes the
fear of God a vain thing, and discourages prayer. &lsquo;With us are
the aged and hoary-headed.&rsquo; (Job is a neologist.) Eliphaz paints
human nature in Calvinistic colours.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Behold, (God) putteth no trust in his ministering
spirits,</p>
<p class="line">And the heavens are not pure in his sight;</p>

<p class="line">Who drinketh iniquity as water!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The wise have related, and they got it from the
fathers to whom the land was given, and among whom no stranger was
allowed to bring his strange doctrines, that affliction is the sign and
punishment of wickedness.</p>
<p>Job merely says he has heard enough of this, and finds no wise man
among them. He acknowledges that such reproaches add to his sorrows. He
would rather contend with God than with them, if he could. But he sees
a slight indication of divine favour in the remarkable unwisdom of his
revilers, and their failure to prove their point. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>Bildad draws a picture of what he considers would be the proper
environment of a wicked man, and it closely resembles the situation of
Job.</p>
<p>But Job reminds him that he, Bildad, is not God. It is God that has
brought him so low, but God has been satisfied with his flesh. He has
not yet uttered any complaint as to his conduct; and so he, Job,
believes that his vindicator will yet appear to confront his
accusers&mdash;the men who are so glib when his afflictor is
silent.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3989src" href="#xd26e3989" name=

<p>Zophar harps on the old string. Pretty much as some preachers go on
endlessly with their pictures of the terrors which haunted the
deathbeds of Voltaire and Paine, all the more because none are present
to relate the facts. Zophar recounts how men who seemed good, but were
not, were overtaken by asps and vipers and fires from heaven.</p>
<p>But Job, on the other hand, has a curious catalogue of examples in
which the notoriously wicked have lived in wealth and gaiety. And if it
be said God pays such off in their children, Job denies the justice of
that. It is the offender, and not his child, who ought to feel it. The
prosperous and the bitter in soul alike lie down in the dust at last,
the good and the evil; and Job is quite content to admit that he does
not understand it. One thing he does understand: &lsquo;Your
explanations are false.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Eliphaz insists on Job having a dogma. If the orthodox dogma is
not true, put something in its place! Why <i>are</i> you afflicted?
What is, <i>your</i> theory? Is it because God was afraid of your
greatness? It must be as we say, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>and you have been defrauding
and injuring people in secret.</p>
<p>Job, having repeated his ardent desire to meet God face to face as
to his innocence, says he can only conclude that what befalls him and
others is what is &lsquo;appointed&rsquo; for them. His terror indeed
arises from that: the good and the evil seem to be distributed without
reference to human conduct. How darkness conspires with the assassin!
If God were only a man, things might be different; but as it is,
&lsquo;what he desireth that he doeth,&rsquo; and &lsquo;who can turn
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bildad falls back on his dogma of depravity. Man is a
&lsquo;worm,&rsquo; a &lsquo;reptile.&rsquo; Job finds that for a worm
Bildad is very familiar with the divine secrets. If man is morally so
weak he should be lowly in mind also. God by his spirit hath garnished
the heavens; his hand formed the &lsquo;crooked
serpent&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Lo! these are but the borders of his works;</p>
<p class="line">How faint the whisper we have heard of him!</p>
<p class="line">But the thunder of his power who can understand?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Job takes up the position of the agnostic, and the
three &lsquo;Comforters&rsquo; are silenced. The argument has ended
where it had to end. Job then proceeds with sublime eloquence. A man
may lose all outward things, but no man or god can make him utter a
lie, or take from him his integrity, or his consciousness of it.
Friends may reproach him, but he can see that his own heart does not.
That one superiority to the wicked he can preserve. In reviewing his
arguments Job is careful to say that he does <i>not</i> maintain that
good and evil men are on an equality. For one thing, when the wicked
man is in trouble he cannot find resource in his innocence. &lsquo;Can
he delight himself in the Almighty?&rsquo; When such die, their widows
do not bewail them. Men do not befriend oppressors when they come
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>to want. Men hiss them. And with guilt in their
heart they feel their sorrows to be the arrows of God, sent in anger.
In all the realms of nature, therefore, amid its powers, splendours,
and precious things, man cannot find the wisdom which raises him above
misfortune, but only in his inward loyalty to the highest, and freedom
from moral evil.</p>
<p>Then enters a fifth character, Elihu, whose plan is to mediate
between the old dogma and the new agnostic philosophy. He is Orthodoxy
rationalised. Elihu&rsquo;s name is suggestive of his ambiguity; it
seems to mean one whose &lsquo;<i>God</i> is <i>He</i>&rsquo; and he
comes from the tribe of Buz, whose Hebrew meaning might almost be
represented in that English word which, with an added <i>z</i>, would
best convey the windiness of his remarks. Buz was the son of Milkah,
the Moon, and his descendant so came fairly by his theologic
&lsquo;moonshine&rsquo; of the kind which Carlyle has so well described
in his account of Coleridgean casuistry. Elihu means to be fair to both
sides! Elihu sees some truth in both sides! Eclectic Elihu! Job is
perfectly right in thinking he had not done anything to merit his
sufferings, but he did not know what snares were around him, and how he
might have done something wicked but for his affliction. Moreover, God
ruins people now and then just to show how he can lift them up again.
Job ought to have taken this for granted, and then to have expressed it
in the old abject phraseology, saying, &lsquo;I have received
chastisement; I will offend no more! What I see not, teach thou
me!&rsquo; (A truly Elihuic or &lsquo;contemptible&rsquo; answer to
Job&rsquo;s sensible words, &lsquo;Why is light given to a man whose
way is hid?&rsquo; Why administer the rod which enlightens as to the
anger but not its cause, or as to the way of amend?) In fact the
casuistic Elihu casts no light whatever on the situation. He simply
overwhelms him with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157"
name="pb157">157</a>]</span>metaphors and generalities about the divine
justice and mercy, meant to hide this new and dangerous solution which
Job had discovered&mdash;namely, that the old dogmatic theories of evil
were proved false by experience, and that a good man amid sorrow should
admit his ignorance, but never allow terror to wring from him the voice
of guilt, nor the attempt to propitiate divine wrath.</p>
<p>When Jehovah appears on the scene, answering Job out of the
whirlwind, the tone is one of wrath, but the whole utterance is merely
an amplification of what Job had said&mdash;what we see and suffer are
but fringes of a Whole we cannot understand. The magnificence and
wonder of the universe celebrated in that voice of the whirlwind had to
be given the lame and impotent conclusion of Job &lsquo;abhorring
himself,&rsquo; and &lsquo;repenting in dust and ashes.&rsquo; The
conventional Cerberus must have his sop. But none the less does the
great heart of this poem reveal the soul that was not shaken or divided
in prosperity or adversity. The burnt-offering of his prosperous days,
symbol of a worship which refused to include the supposed powers of
mischief, was enjoined on Job&rsquo;s Comforters. They must bend to him
as nearer God than they. And in his high philosophy Job found what is
symbolised in the three daughters born to him: Jemima (the Dove, the
voice of the returning Spring); Kezia (Cassia, the sweet incense);
Kerenhappuch (the horn of beautiful colour, or decoration).</p>
<p>From the Jewish point of view this triumph of Job represented a
tremendous heresy. The idea that afflictions could befall a man without
any reference to his conduct, and consequently not to be influenced by
the normal rites and sacrifices, is one fatal to a priesthood. If evil
may be referred in one case to what is going on far away among gods in
obscurities of the universe, and to some purpose beyond the ken of all
sages, it may so be referred in all cases, and though burnt-offerings
may be resorted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158"
name="pb158">158</a>]</span>formally, they must cease when their
powerlessness is proved. Hence the Rabbins have taken the side of
Job&rsquo;s Comforters. They invented a legend that Job had been a
great magician in Egypt, and was one of those whose sorceries so long
prevented the escape of Israel. He was converted afterwards, but it is
hinted that his early wickedness required the retribution he suffered.
His name was to them the troubler troubled.</p>
<p>Heretical also was the theory that man could get along without any
Angelolatry or Demon-worship. Job in his singleness of service, fearing
God alone, defying the Seraphim and Cherubim from Sama&euml;l down to
do their worst, was a perilous figure. The priests got no part of any
burnt-offering. The sin-offering was of almost sumptuary importance.
Hence the rabbinical theory, already noticed, that it was through
neglect of these expiations to the God of Sin that the morally spotless
Job came under the power of his plagues.</p>
<p>But for precisely the same reasons the story of Job became
representative to the more spiritual class of minds of a genuine as
contrasted with a nominal monotheism, and the piety of the pure, the
undivided heart. Its meaning is so human that it is not necessary to
discuss the question of its connection with the story of
Hari&#347;chandra, or whether its accent was caught from or by the
legends of Zoroaster and of Buddha, who passed unscathed through the
ordeals of Ahriman and Mara. It was repeated in the encounters of the
infant Christ with Herod, and of the adult Christ with Satan. It was
repeated in the unswerving loyalty of the patient Griselda to her
husband. It is indeed the heroic theme of many races and ages, and it
everywhere points to a period when the virtues of endurance and
patience rose up to match the agonies which fear and weakness had tried
to propitiate,&mdash;when man first learned to suffer and be strong.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is nothing about the Satan of the Book of Job to
indicate him as a diabolical character. He appears as a respectable and
powerful personage among the sons of God who present themselves before
Jehovah, and his office is that of a public prosecutor. He goes to and
fro in the earth attending to his duties. He has received certificates
of character from A. Schultens, Herder, Eichorn, Dathe, Ilgen, who
proposed a new word for Satan in the prologue of Job, which would make
him a faithful but too suspicious servant of God.</p>
<p>Such indeed he was deemed originally; but it is easy to see how the
degradation of such a figure must have begun. There is often a clamour
in England for the creation of Public Prosecutors; yet no doubt there
is good ground for the hesitation which its judicial heads feel in
advising such a step. The experience of countries in which Prosecuting
Attorneys exist is not such as to prove the institution one of unmixed
advantage. It is not in human nature for an official person not to make
the most of the duty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160"
name="pb160">160</a>]</span>intrusted to him, and the tendency is to
raise the interest he specially represents above that of justice
itself. A defeated prosecutor feels a certain stigma upon his
reputation as much as a defeated advocate, and it is doubtful whether
it be safe that the fame of any man should be in the least identified
with personal success where justice is trying to strike a true balance.
The recent performances of certain attorneys in England and America
retained by Societies for the Suppression of Vice strikingly illustrate
the dangers here alluded to. The necessity that such salaried social
detectives should perpetually parade before the community as purifiers
of society induces them to get up unreal cases where real ones cannot
be easily discovered. Thus they become Accusers, and from this it is an
easy step to become Slanderers; nor is it a very difficult one which
may make them instigators of the vices they profess to suppress.</p>
<p>The first representations of Satan show him holding in his hand the
scales; but the latter show him trying slyly with hand or foot to press
down that side of the balance in which the evil deeds of a soul are
being weighed against the good. We need not try to track
arch&aelig;ologically this declension of a Prosecutor, by increasing
ardour in his office, through the stages of Accuser, Adversary,
Executioner, and at last Rival of the legitimate Rule, and tempter of
its subjects. The process is simple and familiar. I have before me a
little twopenny book,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4069src" href=
"#xd26e4069" name="xd26e4069src">1</a> which is said to have a vast
circulation, where one may trace the whole mental evolution of Satan.
The ancient Devil-worshipper who has reappeared with such power in
England tells us that he was the reputed son <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>of a
farmer, who had to support a wife and eleven children on from 7s. to
9s. per week, and who sent him for a short time to school. &lsquo;My
schoolmistress reproved me for something wrong, telling me that God
Almighty took notice of children&rsquo;s sins. This stuck to my
conscience a great while; and who this God Almighty could be I could
not conjecture; and how he could know my sins without asking my mother
I could not conceive. At that time there was a person named Godfrey, an
exciseman, in the town, a man of a stern and hard-favoured countenance,
whom I took notice of for having a stick covered with figures, and an
ink-bottle hanging at the button-hole of his coat. I imagined that man
to be employed by God Almighty to take notice and keep an account of
children&rsquo;s sins; and once I got into the market-house and watched
him very narrowly, and found that he was always in a hurry, by his
walking so fast; and I thought he had need to hurry, as he must have a
deal to do to find out all the sins of children!&rsquo; This terror
caused the little Huntington to say his prayers. &lsquo;Punishment for
sin I found was to be inflicted after death, therefore I hated the
churchyard, and would travel any distance round rather than drag my
guilty conscience over that enchanted spot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The child is father to the man. When Huntington, S.S., grew up, it
was to record for the thousands who listened to him as a prophet his
many encounters with the devil. The Satan he believes in is an exact
counterpart of the stern, hard-favoured exciseman whom he had regarded
as God&rsquo;s employ&eacute;. On one occasion he writes, &lsquo;Satan
began to tempt me violently that there was no God, but I reasoned
against the belief of that from my own experience of his dreadful
wrath, saying, How can I credit this suggestion, when (God&rsquo;s)
wrath is already <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span>revealed in my heart, and every curse in
his book levelled at my head.&rsquo; (That seems his only evidence of
God&rsquo;s existence&mdash;his wrath!) &lsquo;The Devil answered that
the Bible was false, and only wrote by cunning men to puzzle and
deceive people. &lsquo;There is no God,&rsquo; said the adversary,
&lsquo;nor is the Bible true.&rsquo; &hellip; I asked, &lsquo;Who,
then, made the world?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;I did, and I made men
too.&rsquo; Satan, perceiving my rationality almost gone, followed me
up with another temptation; that as there was no God I must come back
to his work again, else when he had brought me to hell he would punish
me more than all the rest. I cried out, &lsquo;Oh, what will become of
me! what will become of me!&rsquo; He answered that there was no escape
but by praying to him; and that he would show me some lenity when he
took me to hell. I went and sat in my tool-house halting between two
opinions; whether I should petition Satan, or whether I should keep
praying to God, until I could ascertain the consequences. While I was
thinking of bending my knees to such a cursed being as Satan, an
uncommon fear of God sprung up in my heart to keep me from
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In other words, Mr. Huntington wavered between the petitions
&lsquo;Good Lord! Good Devil!&rsquo; The question whether it were more
moral, more holy, to worship the one than the other did not occur to
him. He only considers which is the strongest&mdash;which could do him
the most mischief&mdash;which, therefore, to fear the most; and when
Satan has almost convinced him in his own favour, he changes round to
God. Why? Not because of any superior goodness on God&rsquo;s part. He
says, &lsquo;An uncommon fear of God sprung up in my heart.&rsquo; The
greater terror won the day; that is to say, of two demons he yielded to
the stronger. Such an experience, though that of one living in our own
time, represents a phase in the development <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>of
the relation between God and Satan which would have appeared primitive
to an Assyrian two thousand years ago. The ethical antagonism of the
two was then much more clearly felt. But this bit of contemporary
superstition may bring before us the period when Satan, from having
been a Nemesis or Retributive Agent of the divine law, had become a
mere personal rival of his superior.</p>
<p>Satan, among the Jews, was at first a generic term for an adversary
lying in wait. It is probably the furtive suggestion at the root of
this Hebrew word which aided in its selection as the name for the
invisible adverse powers when they were especially distinguished. But
originally no special personage, much less any antagonist of Jehovah,
was signified by the word. Thus we read: &lsquo;And God&rsquo;s anger
was kindled because he (Balaam) went; and the angel of the Lord stood
in the way for a Satan against him&#8202;&hellip;. And the ass saw the
angel of the Lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his
hand.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4084src" href="#xd26e4084"
name="xd26e4084src">2</a> The eyes of Balaam are presently opened, and
the angel says, &lsquo;I went out to be a Satan to thee because the way
is perverse before me.&rsquo; The Philistines fear to take David with
them to battle lest he should prove a Satan to them, that is, an
underhand enemy or traitor.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4089src" href=
"#xd26e4089" name="xd26e4089src">3</a> David called those who wished to
put Shimei to death Satans;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4094src" href=
"#xd26e4094" name="xd26e4094src">4</a> but in this case the epithet
would have been more applicable to himself for affecting to protect the

"noteref" id="xd26e4099src" href="#xd26e4099" name=

<p>That it was popularly used for adversary as distinct from evil
appears in Solomon&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;There is neither Satan nor
evil occurrent.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4106src" href=
"#xd26e4106" name="xd26e4106src">6</a> Yet it is in connection with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>Solomon that we may note the entrance of some of
the materials for the mythology which afterwards invested the name of
Satan. It is said that, in anger at his idolatries, &lsquo;the Lord
stirred up a Satan unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the
king&rsquo;s seed in Edom.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4113src"
href="#xd26e4113" name="xd26e4113src">7</a> Hadad, &lsquo;the
Sharp,&rsquo; bore a name next to that of Esau himself for the redness
of his wrath, and, as we have seen in a former chapter, Edom was to the
Jews the land of &lsquo;bogeys.&rsquo; &lsquo;Another Satan,&rsquo;
whom the Lord &lsquo;stirred up,&rsquo; was the Devastator, Prince
Rezon, founder of the kingdom of Damascus, of whom it is said,
&lsquo;he was a Satan to Israel all the days of
Solomon.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4118src" href="#xd26e4118"
name="xd26e4118src">8</a> The human characteristics of supposed
&lsquo;Scourges of God&rsquo; easily pass away. The name that becomes
traditionally associated with calamities whose agents were
&lsquo;stirred up&rsquo; by the Almighty is not allowed the glory of
its desolations. The word &lsquo;Satan,&rsquo; twice used in this
chapter concerning Solomon&rsquo;s fall, probably gained here a long
step towards distinct personification as an eminent national enemy,
though there is no intimation of a power daring to oppose the will of
Jehovah. Nor, indeed, is there any such intimation anywhere in the
&lsquo;canonical&rsquo; books of the Old Testament. The writer of
<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps%20109&amp;version=NRSV">
Psalm cix</a>., imprecating for his adversaries, says: &lsquo;Set thou
a wicked man over him; and let Satan stand at his right hand. When he
shall be judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become
sin.&rsquo; In this there is an indication of a special Satan, but he
is supposed to be an agent of Jehovah. In the catalogue of the curses
invoked of the Lord, we find the evils which were afterwards supposed
to proceed only from Satan. The only instance in the Old Testament in
which there is even a faint suggestion of hostility towards Satan on
the part of Jehovah is in Zechariah. Here we find the following
remarkable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>words: &lsquo;And he showed me Joshua the high
priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and the Satan standing at
his right hand to oppose him. And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah
rebuke thee, O Satan; even Jehovah, that hath chosen Jerusalem, rebuke
thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? Now Joshua was
clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. And he
answered and spake to those that stood before him, saying, Take away
the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Lo, I have caused
thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with goodly
raiment.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4129src" href="#xd26e4129"
name="xd26e4129src">9</a></p>
<p>Here we have a very fair study and sketch of that judicial trial of
the soul for which mainly the dogma of a resurrection after death was
invented. The doctrine of future rewards and punishments is not one
which a priesthood would invent or care for, so long as they possessed
unrestricted power to administer such in this life. It is when an alien
power steps in to supersede the priesthood&mdash;the Gallio too
indifferent whether ceremonial laws are carried out to permit the full
application of terrestrial cruelties&mdash;that the priest requires a
tribunal beyond the grave to execute his sentence. In this picture of
Zechariah we have this invisible Celestial Court. The Angel of Judgment
is in his seat. The Angel of Accusation is present to prosecute. A poor
filthy wretch appears for trial. What advocate can he command? Where is
Michael, the special advocate of Israel? He does not recognise one of
his clients in this poor Joshua in his rags. But lo! suddenly Jehovah
himself appears; reproves his own commissioned Accuser; declares Joshua
a brand plucked from the burning (Tophet); orders a change of raiment,
and, condoning his offences, takes him into his own service.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>But in all this there is nothing to show general
antagonism between Jehovah and Satan, but the reverse.</p>
<p>When we look into the Book of Job we find a Satan sufficiently
different from any and all of those mentioned under that name in other
parts of the Old Testament to justify the belief that he has been
mainly adapted from the traditions of other regions. The plagues and
afflictions which in Psalm cix. are invoked from Jehovah, even while
Satan is mentioned as near, are in the Book of Job ascribed to Satan
himself. Jehovah only permits Satan to inflict them with a proviso
against total destruction. Satan is here named as a personality in a
way not known elsewhere in the Old Testament, unless it be in <a class=

1 Chron. xxi. 1</a>, where Satan (the article being in this single case
absent) is said to have &lsquo;stood up against Israel, and provoked
David to number Israel.&rsquo; But in this case the uniformity of the
passage with the others (excepting those in Job) is preserved by the
same incident being recorded in <a class="biblink xd26e43" title=

Israel, and he (Jehovah) moved David against them to say, Go number
Israel and Judah.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is clear that, in the Old Testament, it is in the Book of Job
alone that we find Satan as the powerful prince of an empire which is
distinct from that of Jehovah,&mdash;an empire of tempest, plague, and
fire,&mdash;though he presents himself before Jehovah, and awaits
permission to exert his power on a loyal subject of Jehovah. The
formality of a trial, so dear to the Semitic heart, is omitted in this
case. And these circumstances confirm the many other facts which prove
this drama to be largely of non-Semitic origin. It is tolerably clear
that the drama of Hari&#347;chandra in India and that of Job were both
developed from the Sanskrit legends mentioned in our chapter on
Visw&aacute;mitra; and it is certain that Aryan and Semitic
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>elements are both represented in the figure of
Satan as he has passed into the theology of Christendom.</p>
<p>Nor indeed has Satan since his importation into Jewish literature in
this new aspect, much as the Rabbins have made of him, ever been
assigned the same character among that people that has been assigned
him in Christendom. He has never replaced Sama&euml;l as their
Archfiend. Rabbins have, indeed, in later times associated him with the
Serpent which seduced Eve in Eden; but the absence of any important
reference to that story in the New Testament is significant of the
slight place it had in the Jewish mind long after the belief in Satan
had become popular. In fact, that essentially Aryan myth little
accorded with the ideas of strife and immorality which the Jews had
gradually associated with Sama&euml;l. In the narrative, as it stands
in Genesis, it is by no means the Serpent that makes the worst
appearance. It is Jehovah, whose word&mdash;that death shall follow on
the day the apple is eaten&mdash;is falsified by the result; and while
the Serpent is seen telling the truth, and guiding man to knowledge,
Jehovah is represented as animated by jealousy or even fear of
man&rsquo;s attainments. All of which is natural enough in an extremely
primitive myth of a combat between rival gods, but by no means
possesses the moral accent of the time and conditions amid which
Jahvism certainly originated. It is in the same unmoral plane as the
contest of the Devas and Asuras for the Amrita, in Hindu mythology, a
contest of physical force and wits.</p>

</div>
<p>The real development of Satan among the Jews was from an accusing to
an opposing spirit, then to an agent of punishment&mdash;a hated
executioner. The fact that the figure here given (<a href="#fig05">Fig.
5</a>) was identified by one so familiar with Semitic demonology as
Calmet as a representation of him, is extremely interesting. It was
found among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>representations of Cherubim, and on the back of
one somewhat like it is a formula of invocation against demons. The
countenance is of that severe beauty which the Greeks ascribed to
Nemesis. Nemesis has at her feet the wheel and rudder, symbols of her
power to overtake the evil-doer by land or sea; the feet of this figure
are winged for pursuit. He has four hands. In one he bears the lamp
which, like Lucifer, brings light on the deed of darkness. As to
others, he <span class="corr" id="xd26e4168" title=
"Source: anwers">answers</span> Baruch&rsquo;s description (Ep. 13, 14)
of the Babylonian god, &lsquo;He hath a sceptre in his hand like a man,
like a judge of the kingdom&mdash;he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>hath in his hand a
sword and an axe.&rsquo; He bears nicely-graduated implements of
punishment, from the lash that scourges to the axe that slays; and his
retributive powers are supplemented by the scorpion tail. At his knees
are signets; whomsoever he seals are sealed. He has the terrible eyes
which were believed able to read on every forehead a catalogue of sins
invisible to mortals, a power that made women careful of their veils,
and gave meaning to the formula &lsquo;Get thee behind
me!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4173src" href="#xd26e4173" name=
"xd26e4173src">10</a></p>
<p>Now this figure, which Calmet believed to be Satan, bears on its
reverse, &lsquo;The Everlasting Sun.&rsquo; He is a god made up of
Egyptian and Magian forms, the head-plumes belonging to the one, the
multiplied wings to the other. Matter (<i>Hist. Crit. de Gnost.</i>)
reproduces it, and says that &lsquo;it differs so much from all else of
the kind as to prove it the work of an impostor.&rsquo; But Professor
C. W. King has a (probably fifth century) gem in his collection
evidently a rude copy of this (reproduced in his
&lsquo;Gnostics,&rsquo; Pl. xi. 3), on the back of which is
&lsquo;Light of Lights;&rsquo; and, in a note which I have from him, he
says that it sufficiently proves Matter wrong, and that this form was
primitive. In one gem of Professor King&rsquo;s (Pl. v. 1) the lamp is
also carried, and means the &lsquo;Light of Lights.&rsquo; The
inscription beneath, within a coiled serpent, is in corrupt cuneiform
characters, long preserved by the Magi, though without understanding
them. There is little doubt, therefore, that the instinct of Calmet was
right, and that we have here an early form of the detective and
retributive Magian deity ultimately degraded to an accusing spirit, or
Satan.</p>
<p>Although the Jews did not identify Satan with their Scapegoat, yet
he has been veritably the Scapegoat among devils for two thousand
years. All the nightmares and phantasms that ever haunted the human
imagination <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>have been packed upon him unto this day, when it
is almost as common to hear his name in India and China as in Europe
and America. In thus passing round the world, he has caught the varying
features of many fossilised demons: he has been horned, hoofed,
reptilian, quadrupedal, anthropoid, anthropomorphic, beautiful, ugly,
male, female; the whites painted him black, and the blacks, with more
reason, painted him white. Thus has Satan been made a miracle of
incongruities. Yet through all these protean shapes there has persisted
the original characteristic mentioned. He is prosecutor and executioner
under the divine government, though his office has been debased by that
mental confusion which, in the East, abhors the burner of corpses, and,
in the West, regards the public hangman with contempt; the abhorrence,
in the case of Satan, being intensified by the supposition of an
overfondness for his work, carried to the extent of instigating the
offences which will bring him victims.</p>
<p>In a well-known English Roman Catholic book<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4190src" href="#xd26e4190" name="xd26e4190src">11</a> of recent
times, there is this account of St. Francis&rsquo; visit to hell in
company with the Angel Gabriel:&mdash;&lsquo;St. Francis saw that, on
the other side of (a certain) soul, there was another devil to mock at
and reproach it. He said, Remember where you are, and where you will be
for ever; how short the sin was, how long the punishment. It is your
own fault; when you committed that mortal sin you knew how you would be
punished. What a good bargain you made to take the pains of eternity in
exchange for the sin of a day, an hour, a moment. You cry now for your
sin, but your crying comes too late. You liked bad company; you will
find bad company enough here. Your father was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>a
drunkard, look at him there drinking red-hot fire. You were too idle to
go to mass on Sundays; be as idle as you like now, for there is no mass
to go to. You disobeyed your father, but you dare not disobey him who
is your father in hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This devil speaks as one carrying out the divine decrees. He
preaches. He utters from his chasuble of flame the sermons of Father
Furniss. And, no doubt, wherever belief in Satan is theological, this
is pretty much the form which he assumes before the mind (or what such
believers would call their mind, albeit really the mind of some Syrian
dead these two thousand years). But the Satan popularly personalised
was man&rsquo;s effort to imagine an enthusiasm of inhumanity. He is
the necessary appendage to a personalised Omnipotence, whose thoughts
are not as man&rsquo;s thoughts, but claim to coerce these. His
degradation reflects the heartlessness and the ingenuity of torture
which must always represent personal government with its catalogue of
fictitious crimes. Offences against mere Majesty, against iniquities
framed in law, must be doubly punished, the thing to be secured being
doubly weak. Under any theocratic government law and punishment would
become the types of diabolism. Satan thus has a twofold significance.
He reports what powerful priesthoods found to be the obstacles to their
authority; and he reports the character of the priestly despotisms
which aimed to obstruct human development. <span class=

<h2 class="main">Religious Despotism.</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="first">Pharaoh and Herod&mdash;Zoroaster&rsquo;s
mother&mdash;Ahriman&rsquo;s emissaries&mdash;Kansa and
Krishna&mdash;Emissaries of Kansa&mdash;Astyages and
Cyrus&mdash;Zoh&aacute;k&mdash;Bel and the Christian.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Jews had already, when Christ appeared, formed the
theory that the hardening of Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, and his resistance
to the departure of Israel from Egypt, were due to diabolical sorcery.
The belief afterwards matured; that Edom (Esau or Sama&euml;l) was the
instigator of Roman aggression was steadily forming. The mental
conditions were therefore favourable to the growth of a belief in the
Jewish followers of Christ that the hostility to the religious movement
of their time was another effort on the part of Sama&euml;l to crush
the kingdom of God. Herod was not, indeed, called Satan or Sama&euml;l,
nor was Pharaoh; but the splendour and grandeur of this Idumean (the
realm of Esau), notwithstanding his oppressions and crimes, had made
him a fair representative to the people of the supernatural power they
dreaded. Under these circumstances it was a powerful appeal to the
sympathies of the Jewish people to invent in connection with Herod a
myth exactly similar to that associated with Pharaoh,&mdash;namely, a
conspiracy with sorcerers, and consequent massacre of all new-born
children.</p>
<p>The myths which tell of divine babes supernaturally saved from royal
hostility are veritable myths, even <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>where they occur so
late in time that historic names and places are given; for, of course,
it is impossible that by any natural means either Pharaoh or Herod
should be aware of the peculiar nature of any particular infant born in
their dominions. Such traditions, when thus presented in historical
guise, can only be explained by reference to corresponding fables
written out in simpler mythic form; while it is especially necessary to
remember that such corresponding narratives may be of independent
ethnical origin, and that the later in time may be more primitive
spiritually.</p>
<p>In the Legend of Zoroaster<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4215src" href=
"#xd26e4215" name="xd26e4215src">1</a> his mother Dogdo, previous to
his birth, has a dream in which she sees a black cloud, which, like the
wing of some vast bird, hides the sun, and brings on frightful
darkness. This cloud rains down on her house terrible beasts with sharp
teeth,&mdash;tigers, lions, wolves, rhinoceroses, serpents. One monster
especially attacks her with great fury, and her unborn babe speaks in
reassuring terms. A great light rises and the beasts fall. A beautiful
youth appears, hurls a book at the Devas (Devils), and they fly, with
exception of three,&mdash;a wolf, a lion, and a tiger. These, however,
the youth drives away with a luminous horn. He then replaces the holy
infant in the womb, and says to the mother: &lsquo;Fear nothing! The
King of Heaven protects this infant. The earth waits for him. He is the
prophet whom Ormuzd sends to his people: his law will fill the world
with joy: he will make the lion and the lamb drink in the same place.
Fear not these ferocious beasts; why should he whom Ormuzd preserves
fear the enmity of the whole world?&rsquo; With these words the youth
vanished, and Dogdo awoke. Repairing to an interpreter, she was told
that the Horn meant the grandeur of Ormuzd; the Book was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>the
Avesta; the three Beasts betokened three powerful enemies.</p>
<p>Zoroaster was born laughing. This prodigy being noised abroad, the
Magicians became alarmed, and sought to slay the child. One of them
raised a sword to strike him, but his arm fell to the ground. The
Magicians bore the child to the desert, kindled a fire and threw him
into it, but his mother afterwards found him sleeping tranquilly and
unharmed in the flames. Next he was thrown in front of a drove of cows
and bulls, but the fiercest of the bulls stood carefully over the child
and protected him. The Magicians killed all the young of a pack of
wolves, and then cast the infant Zoroaster to them that they might vent
their rage upon him, but the mouths of the wolves were shut. They
abandoned the child on a lonely mountain, but two ewes came and suckled
him.</p>
<p>Zoroaster&rsquo;s father respected the ministers of the Devas
(Magi), but his child rebuked him. Zoroaster walked on the water
(crossing a great river where was no bridge) on his way to Mount Iran
where he was to receive the Law. It was then he had the vision of the
battle between the two serpent armies,&mdash;the white and black
adders, the former, from the South, conquering the latter, which had
come from the North to destroy him.</p>
<p>The Legend of the Infant Krishna is as follows:&mdash;The tyrant
Kansa, having given his sister Devaki in marriage to Vasud&eacute;va,
as he was returning from the wedding heard a voice declare, &lsquo;The
eighth son of Devaki is destined to be thy destroyer.&rsquo; Alarmed at
this, Kansa cast his sister and her husband into a prison with seven
iron doors, and whenever a son was born he caused it to be instantly
destroyed. When Devaki became pregnant the eighth time, Brahma and
Siva, with attending Devas, appeared and sang: &lsquo;O favoured among
women! in thy delivery <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>all nature shall have cause to
exult! How ardently we long to behold that face for the sake of which
we have coursed round three worlds!&rsquo; When Krishna was born a
chorus of celestial spirits saluted him; the room was illumined with
supernatural light. While Devaki was weeping at the fatal decree of
Kansa that her son should be destroyed, a voice was heard by
Vasud&eacute;va saying: &lsquo;Son of Yadu, carry this child to Gokul,
on the other side of the river Jumna, to Nauda, whose wife has just
given birth to a daughter. Leave him and bring the girl hither.&rsquo;
At this the seven doors swung open, deep sleep fell on the guards, and
Vasud&eacute;va went forth with the holy infant in his arms. The river
Jumna was swollen, but the waters, having kissed the feet of Krishna,
retired on either side, opening a pathway. The great serpent of Vishnu
held its hood over this new incarnation of its Lord. Beside sleeping
Nauda and his wife the daughter was replaced by the son, who was named
Krishna, the Dark.</p>
<p>When all this had happened a voice came to Kansa saying: &lsquo;The
boy destined to destroy thee is born, and is now living.&rsquo;
Whereupon Kansa ordered all the male children in his kingdom to be
destroyed. This being ineffectual, the whereabouts of Krishna were
discovered; but the messenger who was sent to destroy the child beheld
its image in the water and adored it. The Rakshasas worked in the
interest of Kansa. One approached the divine child in shape of a
monstrous bull whose head he wrung off; and he so burned in the stomach
of a crocodile which had swallowed him that the monster cast him from
his mouth unharmed.</p>
<p>Finally, as a youth, Krishna, after living some time as a herdsman,
attacked the tyrant Kansa, tore the crown from his head, and dragged
him by his hair a long way; with the curious result that Kansa became
liberated from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>the three worlds, such virtue had long thinking
about the incarnate one, even in enmity!</p>
<p>The divine beings represented in these legends find their complement
in the fabulous history of Cyrus; and the hostile powers which sought
their destruction are represented in demonology by the Persian
tyrant-devil Zoh&aacute;k. The name of Astyages, the grandfather of
Cyrus, has been satisfactorily traced to Ashdah&aacute;k, and Ajis
Dah&aacute;ka, the &lsquo;biting snake.&rsquo; The word thus connects
him with Vedic Ahi and with Iranian Zoh&aacute;k, the tyrant out of
whose shoulders a magician evoked two serpents which adhered to him and
became at once his familiars and the arms of his cruelty. As Astyages,
the last king of Media, he had a dream that the offspring of his
daughter Mandane would reign over Asia. He gave her in marriage to
Cambyses, and when she bore a child (Cyrus), committed it to his
minister Harpagus to be slain. Harpagus, however, moved with pity, gave
it to a herdsman of Astyages, who substituted for it a still-born
child, and having so satisfied the tyrant of its death, reared Cyrus as
his own son.</p>
<p>The luminous Horn of the Zoroastrian legend and the diabolism of
Zoh&aacute;k are both recalled in the Book of Daniel (viii.) in the
terrific struggle of the ram and the he-goat. The he-goat, ancient
symbol of hairy Esau, long idealised into the Invisible Foe of Israel,
had become associated also with Babylon and with Nimrod its founder,
the Semitic Zoh&aacute;k. But Bel, conqueror of the Dragon, was the
founder of Babylon, and to Jewish eyes the Dragon was his familiar; to
the Jews he represented the tyranny and idolatry of Nimrod, the two
serpents of Zoh&aacute;k. When Cyrus supplanted Astyages, this was the
idol he found the Babylonians worshipping until Daniel destroyed it.
And so, it would appear, came about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>fact that to the Jews
the power of Christendom came to be represented as the Reign of Bel.
One can hardly wonder at that. If ever there were cruelty and
oppression passing beyond the limit of mere human capacities, it has
been recorded in the tragical history of Jewish sufferings. The
disbeliever in pr&aelig;ternatural powers of evil can no less than
others recognise in this &lsquo;Bel and the Christian,&rsquo; which the
Jews substituted for &lsquo;Bel and the Dragon,&rsquo; the real
archfiend&mdash;Superstition, turning human hearts to stone when to
stony gods they sacrifice their own humanity and the welfare of
mankind. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=

<p class="first">The Devil, having shown Jesus all the kingdoms of this
world, said, &lsquo;All this power will I give thee, and the glory of
them: for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give
it,&rsquo; The theory thus announced is as a vast formation underlying
many religions. As every religion begins as an ideal, it must find
itself in antagonism to the world at large; and since the social and
political world are themselves, so long as they last, the outcome of
nature, it is inevitable that in primitive times the earth should be
regarded as a Satanic realm, and the divine world pictured elsewhere. A
legitimate result of this conclusion is asceticism, and belief in the
wickedness of earthly enjoyments. To men of great intellectual powers,
generally accompanied as they are with keen susceptibilities of
enjoyment and strong sympathies, the renunciation of this world must be
as a living burial. To men who, amid the corruptions of the world, feel
within them the power to strike in with effect, or who, seeing
&lsquo;with how little wisdom the world is governed,&rsquo; are stirred
by the sense of power, the struggle against the temptation to lead in
the kingdoms of this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179"

the sense of those temptations which make the almost invariable ordeal
of the traditional founders of religions. As in earlier times the god
won his spurs, so to say, by conquering some monstrous beast, the saint
or saviour must have overcome some potent many-headed world, with gems
for scales and double-tongue, coiling round the earth, and thence, like
Lilith&rsquo;s golden hair, round the heart of all surrendered to its
seductions.</p>
<p>It is remarkable to note the contrast between the visible and
invisible worlds which surrounded the spiritual pilgrimage of Sakya
Muni to Buddhahood or enlightenment. At his birth there is no trace of
political hostility: the cruel Kansa, Herod, Magicians seeking to
destroy, are replaced by the affectionate force of a king trying to
retain his son. The universal traditions reach their happy height in
the ecstatic gospels of the Siamese.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4263src" href="#xd26e4263" name="xd26e4263src">1</a> The universe
was illumined; all jewels shown with unwonted lustre; the air was full
of music; all pain ceased; the blind saw, the deaf heard; the birds
paused in their flight; all trees and plants burst into bloom, and
lotus flowers appeared in every place. Not under the dominion of
Mara<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4266src" href="#xd26e4266" name=
"xd26e4266src">2</a> was this beautiful world. But by turning from all
its youth, health, and life, to think only of its decrepitude, illness,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>death, the Prince Sakya Muni surrounded himself
with another world in which Mara had his share of power. I condense
here the accounts of his encounters with the Prince, who was on his way
to be a hermit.</p>
<p>When the Prince passed out at the palace gates, the king Mara,
knowing that the youth was passing beyond his evil power, determined to
prevent him. Descending from his abode and floating in the air, Mara
cried, &lsquo;Lord, thou art capable of such vast endurance, go not
forth to adopt a religious life, but return to thy kingdom, and in
seven days thou shalt become an emperor of the world, ruling over the
four great continents.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take heed, O Mara!&rsquo; replied
the Prince; &lsquo;I also know that in seven days I might gain
universal empire, but I have no desire for such possessions. I know
that the pursuit of religion is better than the empire of the world.
See how the world is moved, and quakes with praise of this my entry on
a religious life! I shall attain the glorious omniscience, and shall
teach the wheel of the law, that all teachable beings may free
themselves from transmigratory existence. You, thinking only of the
lusts of the flesh, would force me to leave all beings to wander
without guide into your power. Avaunt! get thee away far from
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mara withdrew, but only to watch for another opportunity. It came
when the Prince had reduced himself to emaciation and agony by the
severest austerities. Then Mara presented himself, and pretending
compassion, said, &lsquo;Beware, O grand Being! Your state is pitiable
to look on; you are attenuated beyond measure, and your skin, that was
of the colour of gold, is dark and discoloured. You are practising this
mortification in vain. I can see that you will not live through it.
You, who are a Grand Being, had better give up this course, for be
assured you will derive much more advantage from sacrifices of fire
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>and flowers.&rsquo; Him the Grand Being
indignantly answered, &lsquo;Hearken, thou vile and wicked Mara! Thy
words suit not the time. Think not to deceive me, for I heed thee not.
Thou mayest mislead those who have no understanding, but I, who have
virtue, endurance, and intelligence, who know what is good and what is
evil, cannot be so misled. Thou, O Mara! hast eight generals. Thy first
is delight in the five lusts of the flesh, which are the pleasures of
appearance, sound, scent, flavour, and touch. Thy second general is
wrath, who takes the form of vexation, indignation, and desire to
injure. Thy third is concupiscence. Thy fourth is desire. Thy fifth is
impudence. Thy sixth is arrogance. Thy seventh is doubt. And thine
eighth is ingratitude. These are thy generals, who cannot be escaped by
those whose hearts are set on honour and wealth. But I know that he who
can contend with these thy generals shall escape beyond all sorrow, and
enjoy the most glorious happiness. Therefore I have not ceased to
practise mortification, knowing that even were I to die whilst thus
engaged, it would be a most excellent thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is added that Mara &lsquo;fled in confusion,&rsquo; but the next
incident seems to show that his suggestion was not unheeded; for
&lsquo;after he had departed,&rsquo; the Grand Being had his vision of
the three-stringed guitar&mdash;one string drawn too tightly, the
second too loosely, the third moderately&mdash;which last, somewhat in
defiance of orchestral ideas, alone gave sweet music, and taught him
that moderation was better than excess or laxity. By eating enough he
gained that pristine strength and beauty which offended the five
Brahmans so that they left him. The third and final effort of Mara
immediately preceded the Prince&rsquo;s attainment of the order of
Buddha under the Bo-tree. He now sent his three daughters, Raka (Love),
Aradi (Anger), Tanha (Desire). Beautifully bedecked they approached
him, and Raka said, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182"
name="pb182">182</a>]</span>&lsquo;Lord, fearest thou not death?&rsquo;
But he drove her away. The two others also he drove away as they had no
charm of sufficient power to entice him. Then Mara assembled his
generals, and said, &lsquo;Listen, ye Maras, that know not sorrow! Now
shall I make war on the Prince, that man without equal. I dare not
attack him in face, but I will circumvent him by approaching on the
north side. Assume then all manner of shapes, and use your mightiest
powers, that he may flee in terror.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having taken on fearful shapes, raising awful sounds, headed by Mara
himself, who had assumed immense size, and mounted his elephant
Girimaga, a thousand miles in height, they advanced; but they dare not
enter beneath the shade of the holy Bo-tree. They frightened away,
however, the Lord&rsquo;s guardian angels, and he was left alone. Then
seeing the army approaching from the north, he reflected, &lsquo;Long
have I devoted myself to a life of mortification, and now I am alone,
without a friend to aid me in this contest. Yet may I escape the Maras,
for the virtue of my transcendent merits will be my army.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Help me,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;ye thirty Barami! ye powers of
accumulated merit, ye powers of Almsgiving, Morality, Relinquishment,
Wisdom, Fortitude, Patience, Truth, Determination, Charity, and
Equanimity, help me in my fight with Mara!&rsquo; The Lord was seated
on his jewelled throne (the same that had been formed of the grass on
which he sat), and Mara with his army exhausted every resource of
terror&mdash;monstrous beasts, rain of missiles and burning ashes,
gales that blew down mountain peaks&mdash;to inspire him with fear; but
all in vain! Nay, the burning ashes were changed to flowers as they
fell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come down from thy throne,&rsquo; shouted the evil-formed
one; &lsquo;come down, or I will cut thine heart into atoms!&rsquo; The
Lord replied, &lsquo;This jewelled throne was created by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>the
power of my merits, for I am he who will teach all men the remedy for
death, who will redeem all beings, and set them free from the sorrows
of circling existence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mara then claimed that the throne belonged to himself, and had been
created by his own merits; and on this armed himself with the Chakkra,
the irresistible weapon of Indra, and Wheel of the Law. Yet Buddha
answered, &lsquo;By the thirty virtues of transcendent merits, and the
five alms, I have obtained the throne. Thou, in saying that this throne
was created by thy merits, tellest an untruth, for indeed there is no
throne for a sinful, horrible being such as thou art.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then furious Mara hurled the Chakkra, which clove mountains in its
course, but could not pass a canopy of flowers which rose over the
Lord&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>And now the great Being asked Mara for the witnesses of his acts of
merit by virtue of which he claimed the throne. In response,
Mara&rsquo;s generals all bore him witness. Then Mara challenged him,
&lsquo;Tell me now, where is the man that can bear witness for
thee?&rsquo; The Lord reflected, &lsquo;Truly here is no man to bear me
witness, but I will call on the earth itself, though it has neither
spirit nor understanding, and it shall be my witness.<span class="corr"
id="xd26e4302" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> Stretching forth
his hand, he thus invoked the earth: &lsquo;O holy Earth! I who have
attained the thirty powers of virtue, and performed the five great
alms, each time that I have performed a great act have not failed to
pour water on thee. Now that I have no other witness, I call upon thee
to give thy testimony!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The angel of the earth appeared in shape of a lovely woman, and
answered, &lsquo;O Being more excellent than angels or men! it is true
that, when you performed your great works, you ever poured water on my
hair.&rsquo; And with these words she wrung her long hair, and from it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>issued a stream, a torrent, a flood, in which
Mara and his hosts were overturned, their insignia destroyed, and King
Mara put to flight, amid the loud rejoicings of angels.</p>
<p>Then the evil one and his generals were conquered not only in power
but in heart; and Mara, raising his thousand arms, paid reverence,
saying, &lsquo;Homage to the Lord, who has subdued his body even as a
charioteer breaks his horses to his use! The Lord will become the
omniscient Buddha, the Teacher of angels, and Brahmas, and Yakkhas
(demons), and men. He will confound all Maras, and rescue men from the
whirl of transmigration!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The menacing powers depicted as assailing Sakya Muni appear only
around the infancy of Zoroaster. The interview of the latter with
Ahriman hardly amounts to a severe trial, but still the accent of the
chief temptation both of Buddha and Christ is in it, namely, the
promise of worldly empire. It was on one of those midnight journeys
through Heaven and Hell that Zoroaster saw Ahriman, and delivered from
his power &lsquo;one who had done both good and evil.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4313src" href="#xd26e4313" name="xd26e4313src">3</a>
When Ahriman met Zoroaster&rsquo;s gaze, he cried, &lsquo;Quit thou the
pure law; cast it to the ground; thou wilt then be in the world all
that thou canst desire. Be not anxious about thy end. At least, do not
destroy my subjects, O pure Zoroaster, son of Poroscharp, who art born
of her thou hast borne!&rsquo; Zoroaster answered, &lsquo;Wicked
Majesty! it is for thee and thy worshippers that Hell is prepared, but
by the mercy of God I shall bury your work with shame and
ignominy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the account of Matthew, Satan begins his temptation of Jesus in
the same way and amid similar circumstances to those we find in the
Siamese legends of Buddha. It occurs in a wilderness, and the appeal is
to hunger. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>temptation of Buddha, in which Mara promises the
empire of the world, is also repeated in the case of Satan and Jesus
(<a href="#fig06">Fig. 6</a>). The menaces, however, in this case, are
relegated to the infancy, and the lustful temptation is absent
altogether. Mark has an allusion to his being in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>the
wilderness forty days &lsquo;with the beasts,&rsquo; which may mean
that Satan &lsquo;drove&rsquo; him into a region of danger to inspire
fear. In <a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke&amp;version=NRSV">Luke</a>
we have the remarkable claim of Satan that the authority over the world
has been delivered to himself, and he gives it to whom he will; which
Jesus does not deny, as Buddha did the similar claim of Mara. As in the
case of Buddha, the temptation of Jesus ends his fasting; angels bring
him food (<span class="trans" title=
"di&#275;konoun ayt&#333;"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&delta;&iota;&eta;&kappa;&#8057;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu;
&#7936;&upsilon;&tau;&#8182;</span></span> probably means that), and
thenceforth he eats and drinks, to the scandal of the ascetics.</p>
<p>The essential addition in the case of Jesus is the notable
temptation to try and perform a crucial act. Satan quotes an accredited
messianic prophecy, and invites Jesus to test his claim to be the
predicted deliverer by casting himself from the pinnacle of the Temple,
and testing the promise that angels should protect the true Son of God.
Strauss,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4346src" href="#xd26e4346" name=
"xd26e4346src">4</a> as it appears to me, has not considered the
importance of this in connection with the general situation.
&lsquo;Assent,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;cannot be withheld from the canon
that, to be credible, the narrative must ascribe nothing to the devil
inconsistent with his established cunning. Now, the first temptation,
appealing to hunger, we grant, is not ill-conceived; if this were
ineffectual, the devil, as an artful tactician, should have had a yet
more alluring temptation at hand; but instead of this, we find him, in
Matthew, proposing to Jesus the neck-breaking feat of casting himself
down from the pinnacle of the Temple&mdash;a far less inviting miracle
than the metamorphosis of the stones. This proposition finding no
acceptance, there follows, as a crowning effort, a suggestion which,
whatever might be the bribe, every true Israelite would instantly
reject with abhorrence&mdash;to fall down and worship the devil.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not so! The scapegoat was a perpetual act of worship to the Devil.
In this story of the temptation of Christ there enter some
characteristic elements of the temptation of Job.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4354src" href="#xd26e4354" name="xd26e4354src">5</a> Uz in the
one case and the wilderness in the other mean morally the same, the
region ruled over by Azazel. In both cases the trial is under divine
direction. And the trial is in both cases to secure a division of
worship between the good and evil powers, which was so universal in the
East that it was the test of exceptional piety if one did not swerve
from an unmixed sacrifice. Jesus is apparently abandoned by the God in
whom he trusted; he is &lsquo;driven&rsquo; into a wilderness, and
there kept with the beasts and without food. The Devil alone comes to
him; exhibits his own miraculous power by bearing him through the air
to his own Mount Seir, and showing him the whole world in a moment of
time; and now says to him, as it were, &lsquo;Try your God! See if
<i>he</i> will even turn stones into bread to save his own son, to whom
I offer the kingdoms of the world!&rsquo; Then bearing him into the
&lsquo;holy hill&rsquo; of his own God&mdash;the pinnacle of the
Temple&mdash;says, &lsquo;Try now a leap, and see if <i>he</i> saves
from being dashed to pieces, even in his own precincts, his so trustful
devotee, whom I have borne aloft so safely! Which, then, has the
greater power to protect, enrich, advance you,&mdash;he who has left
you out here to starve, so that you dare not trust yourself to him, or
I? Fall down then and worship me as your God, and all the world is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>yours! It is the world you are to reign over:
rule it in my name!</p>
<p>When St. Anthony is tempted by the Devil in the form of a lean monk,
it was easy to see that the hermit was troubled with a vision of his
own emaciation. When the Devil appears to Luther under guise of a holy
monk, it is an obvious explanation that he was impressed by a memory of
the holy brothers who still remained in the Church, and who, while they
implored his return, pointed out the strength and influence he had lost
by secession. Equally simple are the moral elements in the story of
Christ&rsquo;s temptation. While a member of John&rsquo;s ascetic
community, for which &lsquo;though he was rich he became poor,&rsquo;
hunger, and such anxiety about a living as victimises many a young
thinker now, must have assailed him. Later on his Devil meets him on
the Temple, quotes scripture, and warns him that his visionary God will
not raise him so high in the Church as the Prince of this World
can.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4367src" href="#xd26e4367" name=
"xd26e4367src">6</a> And finally, when dreams of a larger union,
including Jews and Gentiles, visited him, the power that might be
gained by connivance with universal idolatry would be reflected in the
offer of the kingdoms of the world in payment for the purity of his
aims and singleness of his worship.</p>
<p>That these trials of self-truthfulness and fidelity, occurring at
various phases of life, would be recognised, is certain. A youth of
high position, as Christ probably was,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4372src" href="#xd26e4372" name="xd26e4372src">7</a> or even one
with that great power over the people which all concede, was, in a
worldly sense, &lsquo;throwing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"
href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>away his prospects;&rsquo;
and this voice, real in its time, would naturally be conventionalised.
It would put on the stock costume of devils and angels; and among
Jewish christians it would naturally be associated with the
forty-days&rsquo; fast of Moses (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=

Kings xix. 8</a>), and the forty-years&rsquo; trial of Israel in the
wilderness. Among Greek christians some traces of the legend of
Herakles in his seclusion as herdsman, or at the cross-roads between
Vice and Virtue, might enter; and it is not impossible that some
touches might be added from the Oriental myth which invested
Buddha.</p>
<p>However this may be, we may with certainty repair to the common
source of all such myths in the higher nature of man, and recognise the
power of a pure genius to overcome those temptations to a success
unworthy of itself. We may interpret all such legends with a clearness
proportioned to the sacrifices we have made for truth and ideal right;
and the endless perplexities of commentators and theologians about the
impossible outward details of the New Testament story are simple
confessions that the great spirit so tried is now made to label with
his name his own Tempter&mdash;namely, a Church grown powerful and
wealthy, which, as the Prince of this World, bribes the conscience and
tempts away the talent necessary to the progress of mankind.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A representation of the Temptation of St. Anthony
(marionettes), which I witnessed at Tours (1878), had several points of
significance. It was the medi&aelig;val &lsquo;Morality&rsquo; as
diminished by centuries, and conventionalised among those whom the
centuries mould in ways and for ends they know not. Amid a scenery of
grotesque devils, rudely copied from Callot, St. Anthony appeared, and
was tempted in a way that recalled the old pictures. There was the same
fair Temptress, in this case the wife of Satan, who warns her lord that
his ugly devils will be of no avail against Anthony, and that the whole
affair should be confided to her. She being repelled, the rest of the
performance consisted in the devils continually ringing the bell of the
hermitage, and finally setting fire to it. This conflagration was the
supreme torment of Anthony&mdash;and, sooth to say, it was a fairly
comfortable abode&mdash;who utters piteous prayers and is presently
comforted by an angel bringing him wreaths of evergreen. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>The prayers of the saint and the response of the angel were meant to
be seriously taken; but their pathos was generally met with pardonable
laughter by the crowd in the booth. Yet there was a pathos about it
all, if only this, that the only temptations thought of for a saint
were a sound and quiet house and a mistress. The bell-noise alone
remained from the great picture of Spagnoletto at Siena, where the
unsheltered old man raises his deprecating hand against the disturber,
but not his eyes from the book he reads. In Spagnoletto&rsquo;s picture
there are five large books, pen, ink, and hour-glass; but there is
neither hermitage to be burnt nor female charms to be resisted.</p>
<p>But Spagnoletto, even in his time, was beholding the vision of
exceptional men in the past, whose hunger and thirst was for knowledge,
truth, and culture, and who sought these in solitude. Such men have so
long left the Church familiar to the French peasantry that any
representation of their temptations and trials would be out of place
among the marionettes. The bells which now disturb them are those that
sound from steeples.</p>
<p>Another picture loomed up before my eyes over the puppet performance
at Tours, that which for Bunyan frescoed the walls of Bedford Gaol.
There, too, the old demons, giants, and devils took on grave and vast
forms, and reflected the trials of the Great Hearts who withstood the
Popes and Pagans, the armed political Apollyons and the Giant Despairs,
who could make prisons the hermitages of men born to be saviours of the
people.</p>
<p>Such were the temptations that Milton knew; from his own heart came
the pigments with which he painted the trial of Christ in the
wilderness. &lsquo;Set women in his eye,&rsquo; said Belial:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">The progressive ideas which Milton attributed to Satan
have not failed. That Celestial City which Bunyan found it so hard to
reach has now become a metropolis of wealth and fashion, and the trials
which once beset pilgrims toiling towards it are now transferred to
those who would pass beyond it to another city, seen from afar, with
temples of Reason and palaces of Justice.</p>
<p>The old phantasms have shrunk to puppets. The trials by personal
devils are relegated to the regions of insanity and disease. It is
everywhere a dance of puppets though on a cerebral stage. A lady well
known in Edinburgh related to me a terrible experience she had with the
devil. She had invited some of her relations to visit her for some
days; but these relatives were Unitarians, and, after they had gone,
having entered the room which they had occupied, she was seized by the
devil, thrown on the floor, and her back so strained that she had to
keep her bed for some time. This was to her &lsquo;the Unitarian
fiend&rsquo; of which the Wesleyan Hymn-Book sang so long; but even the
Wesleyans have now discarded the famous couplet, and there must be few
who would not recognise that the old lady at Edinburgh merely had a
tottering body representing a failing mind.</p>
<p>I have just read a book in which a lady in America relates her trial
by the devil. This lady, in her girlhood, was of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>a
christian family, but she married a rabbi and was baptized into
Judaism. After some years of happy life a terrible compunction seized
her; she imagined herself lost for ever; she became ill. A christian
(Baptist) minister and his wife were the evil stars in her case, and
with what terrors they surrounded the poor Jewess may be gathered from
the following extract.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She then left me&mdash;that dear friend left me alone to my
God, and to him I carried a lacerated and bleeding heart, and laid it
at the foot of the cross, as an atonement for the multiplied sins I had
committed, whether of ignorance or wilfulness; and how shall I proceed
to portray the heart-felt agonies of that night preceding my
deliverance from the shafts of Satan? Oh! this weight, this load of
sin, this burden so intolerable that it crushed me to the earth; for
this was a dark hour with me&mdash;the darkest; and I lay calm, to all
appearance, but with cold perspiration drenching me, nor could I close
my eyes; and these words again smote my ear, No redemption, no
redemption; and the tempter came, inviting me, with all his
blandishment and power, to follow him to his court of pleasure. My eyes
were open; I certainly saw him, dressed in the most phantastic shape.
This was no illusion; for he soon assumed the appearance of one of the
gay throng I had mingled with in former days, and beckoned me to
follow. I was awake, and seemed to lie on the brink of a chasm, and
spirits were dancing around me, and I made some slight outcry, and
those dear girls watching with me came to me, and looked at me. They
said I looked at them but could not speak, and they moistened my lips,
and said I was nearly gone; then I whispered, and they came and looked
at me again, but would not disturb me. It was well they did not; for
the power of God was over me, and angels were around me, and whispering
spirits near, and I whispered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194"
href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>in sweet communion with them,
as they surrounded me, and, pointing to the throne of grace, said,
&lsquo;Behold!&rsquo; and I felt that the glory of God was about to
manifest itself; for a shout, as if a choir of angels had tuned their
golden harps, burst forth in, &lsquo;Glory to God on high,&rsquo; and
died away in softest strains of melody. I lifted up my eyes to heaven,
and there, so near as to be almost within my reach, the brightest
vision of our Lord and Saviour stood before me, enveloped with a light,
ethereal mist, so bright and yet transparent that his divine figure
could be seen distinctly, and my eyes were riveted upon him; for this
bright vision seemed to touch my bed, standing at the foot, so near,
and he stretched forth his left hand toward me, whilst with the right
one he pointed to the throne of grace, and a voice came, saying,
&lsquo;Blessed are they who can see God; arise, take up thy cross and
follow me; for though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be white as
wool.&rsquo; And with my eyes fixed on that bright vision, I saw from
the hand stretched toward me great drops of blood, as if from each
finger; for his blessed hand was spread open, as if in prayer, and
those drops fell distinctly, as if upon the earth; and a misty light
encircled me, and a voice again said, &lsquo;Take up <i>thy</i> cross
and follow me; for though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be white as
wool.&rsquo; And angels were all around me, and I saw the throne of
heaven. And, oh! the sweet calm that stole over my senses. It must have
been a foretaste of heavenly bliss. How long I lay after this beautiful
vision I know not; but when I opened my eyes it was early dawn, and I
felt so happy and well. My young friends pressed around my bedside, to
know how I felt, and I said, &lsquo;I am well and so happy.&rsquo; They
then said I was whispering with some one in my dreams all night. I told
them angels <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>were with me; that I was not asleep, and I had
sweet communion with them, and would soon be well.&rsquo;<a class=

<p>That is what the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness comes to when
dislocated from its time and place, and, with its gathered ages of
fable, is imported at last to be an engine of torture sprung on the
nerves of a devout woman. This Jewess was divorced from her husband by
her Christianity; her child died a victim to precocious piety; but what
were home and affection in ruins compared with salvation from that
frightful devil seen in her holy delirium?</p>
<p>History shows that it has always required unusual courage for a
human being to confront an enemy believed to be pr&aelig;ternatural.
This Jewess would probably have been able to face a tiger for the sake
of her husband, but not that fantastic devil. Not long ago an English
actor was criticised because, in playing Hamlet, he cowered with fear
on seeing the ghost, all his sinews and joints seeming to give way; but
to me he appeared then the perfect type of what mankind have always
been when believing themselves in the presence of pr&aelig;ternatural
powers. The limit of courage in human nature was passed when the foe
was one which no earthly power or weapon could reach.</p>
<p>In old times, nearly all the sorcerers and witches were women; and
it may have been, in some part, because woman had more real courage
than man unarmed. Sorcery and witchcraft were but the so-called pagan
rites in their last degradation, and women were the last to abandon the
declining religion, just as they are the last to leave the superstition
which has followed it. Their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>sentiment and affection were
intertwined with it, and the threats of eternal torture by devils which
frightened men from the old faith to the new were less powerful to
shake the faith of women. When pagan priests became christians,
priestesses remained, to become sorceresses. The new faith had
gradually to win the love of the sex too used to martyrdom on earth to
fear it much in hell. And now, again, when knowledge clears away the
old terrors, and many men are growing indifferent to all religion,
because no longer frightened by it, we may expect the churches to be
increasingly kept up by women alone, simply because they went into them
more by attraction of saintly ideals than fear of diabolical
menaces.</p>
<p>Thomas Carlyle has selected Luther&rsquo;s boldness in the presence
of what he believed the Devil to illustrate his valour. &lsquo;His
defiance of the &lsquo;Devils&rsquo; in Worms,&rsquo; says Carlyle,
&lsquo;was not a mere boast, as the like might be if spoken now. It was
a faith of Luther&rsquo;s that there were Devils, spiritual denizens of
the Pit, continually besetting men. Many times, in his writings, this
turns up; and a most small sneer has been grounded on it by some. In
the room of the Wartburg, where he sat translating the Bible, they
still show you a black spot on the wall; the strange memorial of one of
these conflicts. Luther sat translating one of the Psalms; he was worn
down with long labour, with sickness, abstinence from food; there rose
before him some hideous indefinable Image, which he took for the Evil
One, to forbid his work; Luther started up with fiend-defiance; flung
his inkstand at the spectre, and it disappeared! The spot still remains
there; a curious monument of several things. Any apothecary&rsquo;s
apprentice can now tell us what we are to think of this apparition, in
a scientific sense; but the man&rsquo;s heart that dare rise defiant,
face to face, against Hell itself, can give no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>higher proof of fearlessness. The thing he will
quail before exists not on this earth nor under it&mdash;fearless
enough! &lsquo;The Devil is aware,&rsquo; writes he on one occasion,
&lsquo;that this does not proceed out of fear in me. I have seen and
defied innumerable Devils. Duke George,&rsquo;&mdash;of Leipzig, a
great enemy of his,&mdash;&lsquo;Duke George is not equal to one
Devil,&rsquo; far short of a Devil! &lsquo;If I had business at
Leipzig, I would ride into Leipzig, though it rained Duke Georges for
nine days running.&rsquo; What a reservoir of Dukes to ride
into!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4477src" href="#xd26e4477"
name="xd26e4477src">3</a></p>
<p>Although Luther&rsquo;s courage certainly appears in this, it is
plain that his Devil was much humanised as compared with the fearful
phantoms of an earlier time. Nobody would ever have tried an inkstand
on the Gorgons, Furies, Lucifers of ancient belief. In Luther&rsquo;s
Bible the Devil is pictured as a monk&mdash;a lean monk, such as he
himself was only too likely to become if he continued his rebellion
against the Church (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>). It was against a
Devil liable to resistance by physical force that he hurled his
inkstand, and against whom he also hurled the contents of his inkstand
in those words which Richter said were half-battles.</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s Devil, in fact, represents one of the last phases in
the reduction of the Evil Power from a personified phantom with which
no man could cope, to that impersonal but all the more real moral
obstruction with which every man can cope&mdash;if only with an
inkstand. The horned monster with cowl, beads, and cross, is a mere
transparency, through which every brave heart may recognise the
practical power of wrong around him, the established error, disguised
as religion, which is able to tempt and threaten him.</p>
<p>The temptations with menace described&mdash;those which,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>coming upon the weak nerves of women, vanquished
their reason and heart; that which, in a healthy man, raised valour and
power&mdash;may be taken as side-lights for a corresponding experience
in the life of a great man now living&mdash;Carlyle himself. It was at
a period of youth when, amid the lonely hills of Scotland, he wandered
out of harmony with the world in which he lived. Consecrated by pious
parents to the ministry, he had inwardly renounced every dogma of the
Church. With genius and culture for high work, the world demanded of
him low work. Friendless, alone, poor, he sat eating his heart,
probably with little else to eat. Every Scotch parson he met
unconsciously propounded to that youth the question whether he could
convert his heretical stone into bread, or precipitate himself from the
pinnacle of the Scotch Kirk without bruises? Then it was he roamed in
his mystical wilderness, until he found himself in the gayest capital
of the world, which, however, on him had little to bestow but a further
sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, when I look back, it was a strange isolation I then
lived in. The men and women around me, even speaking with me, were but
Figures; I had practically forgotten that they were alive, that they
were not merely automatic. In the midst of their crowded streets and
assemblages, I walked solitary; and (except as it was my own heart, not
another&rsquo;s, that I kept devouring) savage also, as is the tiger in
his jungle. Some comfort it would have been, could I, like a Faust,
have fancied myself tempted and tormented of a Devil; for a Hell, as I
imagine, without Life, though only diabolic Life, were more frightful:
but in our age of Downpulling and Disbelief, the very Devil has been
pulled down&mdash;you cannot so much as believe in a Devil. To me the
Universe was all void of Life, of Purpose, of Volition, even of
Hostility: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>it was one huge, dead, immeasurable,
Steam-engine, rolling on, in its dead indifference, to grind me limb
from limb. Oh, the vast gloomy, solitary Golgotha, and Mill of Death!
Why was the Living banished thither, companionless, conscious? Why, if
there is no Devil; nay, unless the Devil is your God?&rsquo;
&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From suicide a certain aftershine of Christianity withheld
me.&rsquo; &hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So had it lasted, as in bitter, protracted Death-agony,
through long years. The heart within me, unvisited by any heavenly
dewdrop, was smouldering in sulphurous, slow-consuming fire. Almost
since earliest memory I had shed no tear; or once only when I,
murmuring half-audibly, recited Faust&rsquo;s Deathsong, that wild
<i lang="de">Selig der den er im Siegesglanze findet</i> (Happy whom
<i>he</i> finds in Battle&rsquo;s splendour), and thought that of this
last Friend even I was not forsaken, that Destiny itself could not doom
me not to die. Having no hope, neither had I any definite fear, were it
of Man or of Devil; nay, I often felt as if it might be solacing could
the Arch-Devil himself, though in Tartarean terrors, rise to me that I
might tell him a little of my mind. And yet, strangely enough, I lived
in a continual, indefinite, pining fear; tremulous, pusillanimous,
apprehensive of I knew not what; it seemed as if all things in the
Heavens above and the Earth beneath would hurt me; as if the Heavens
and the Earth were but boundless jaws of a devouring monster, wherein
I, palpitating, waited to be devoured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Full of such humour, and perhaps the miserablest man in the
whole French Capital or Suburbs, was I, one sultry Dogday, after much
perambulation, toiling along the dirty little <i>Rue Sainte Thomas de
l&rsquo;Enfer</i>, among civic rubbish enough, in a close atmosphere,
and over pavements hot as Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s Furnace; whereby
doubtless my spirits <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span>were little cheered; when all at once there
rose a Thought in me, and I asked myself, &lsquo;What <i>art</i> thou
afraid of? Wherefore, like a coward, dost thou for ever pip and
whimper, and go cowering and trembling? Despicable biped! what is the
sum-total of the worst that lies before thee? Death? Well, Death; and
say the pangs of Tophet too, and all that the Devil or Man may, will,
or can do against thee! Hast thou not a heart; canst thou not suffer
whatsoever it be; and, as a Child of Freedom, though outcast, trample
Tophet itself under thy feet, while it consumes thee! Let it come,
then; I will meet it and defy it!&rsquo; And as I so thought, there
rushed like a stream of fire over my whole soul; and I shook base Fear
away from me for ever. I was strong, of unknown strength; a spirit,
almost a god. Ever from that time the temper of my misery was changed:
not Fear or whining Sorrow was it, but Indignation and grim fire-eyed
Defiance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus had the <span class="sc">Everlasting No</span> pealed
authoritatively through all the recesses of my Being, of my
<span class="sc">Me</span>; and then was it that my whole <span class=
"sc">Me</span> stood up, in native God-created majesty and with
emphasis recorded its Protest. Such a Protest, the most important
transaction in Life, may that same Indignation and Defiance, in a
psychological point of view, be fitly called. The Everlasting No had
said, &lsquo;Behold thou art fatherless, outcast, and the Universe is
mine (the Devil&rsquo;s);&rsquo; to which my whole Me now made answer,
&lsquo;<i>I</i> am not thine, but Free, and for ever hate
thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is from this hour that I incline to date my spiritual New
Birth, or Baphometic fire-baptism; perhaps I directly thereupon began
to be a Man.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4532src" href=
"#xd26e4532" name="xd26e4532src">4</a></p>
<p>Perhaps he who so uttered his <i>Apage Satana</i> did not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>recognise amid what haunted Edom he wrestled
with his Phantom. Saint Louis, having invited the Carthusian monks to
Paris, assigned them a habitation in the Faubourg Saint-Jacques, near
the ancient chateau of Vauvert, a manor built by Robert (le Diable),
but for a long time then uninhabited, because infested by demons, which
had, perhaps, been false coiners. Fearful howls had been heard there,
and spectres seen, dragging chains; and, in particular, it was
frequented by a fearful green monster, serpent and man in one, with a
long white beard, wielding a huge club, with which he threatened all
who passed that way. This demon, in common belief, passed along the
road to and from the chateau in a fiery chariot, and twisted the neck
of every human being met on his way. He was called the Devil of
Vauvert. The Carthusians were not frightened by these stories, but
asked Louis to give them the Manor, which he did, with all its
dependencies. After that nothing more was heard of the Diable Vauvert
or his imps. It was but fair to the Demons who had assisted the friars
in obtaining a valuable property so cheaply that the street should
thenceforth bear the name of Rue d&rsquo;Enfer, as it does. But the
formidable genii of the place haunted it still, and, in the course of
time, the Carthusians proved that they could use with effect all the
terrors which the Devils had left behind them. They represented a great
money-coining Christendom with which free-thinking Michaels had to
contend, even to the day when, as we have just read, one of the bravest
of these there encountered his Vauvert devil and laid him low for
ever.</p>
<p>I well remember that wretched street of St. Thomas leading into Hell
Street, as if the Parisian authorities, remembering that Thomas was a
doubter, meant to remind the wayfarer that whoso doubteth is damned.
Near by is the convent of St. Michael, who makes no war <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>on
the neighbouring Rue Dragon. All names&mdash;mere idle names! Among the
thousands that crowd along them, how many pause to note the quaintness
of the names on the street-lamps, remaining there from fossil fears and
phantom battles long turned to fairy lore. Yet amid them, on that
sultry day, in one heart, was fought and won a battle which summed up
all their sense and value. Every Hell was conquered then and there when
Fear was conquered. There, when the lower Self was cast down beneath
the poised spear of a Free Mind, St. Michael at last chained his
dragon. There Luther&rsquo;s inkstand was not only hurled, but hit its
mark; there, &lsquo;Get thee behind me,&rsquo; was said, and obeyed;
there Buddha brought the archfiend Mara to kneel at his feet.</p>
<p>And it was by sole might of a Man. Therefore may this be emphasised
as the temptation and triumph which have for us to-day the meaning of
all others.</p>
<p>A young man of intellectual power, seeing beyond all the
conventional errors around him, without means, feeling that ordinary
work, however honourable, would for him mean failure of his
life&mdash;because failure to contribute his larger truth to
mankind&mdash;he finds the terrible cost of his aim to be hunger, want,
a life passed amid suspicion and alienation, without sympathy, lonely,
unloved&mdash;and, alas! with a probability that all these losses may
involve loss of just what they are incurred for, the power to make good
his truth. After giving up love and joy, he may, after all, be unable
to give living service to his truth, but only a broken body and shed
blood. Similar trials in outer form have been encountered again and
again; not only in the great temptations and triumphs of sacred
tradition, but perhaps even more genuinely in the unknown lives of many
pious people all over the world, have hunger, want, suffering, been
conquered by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>faith. But rarely amid doubts. Rarely in the way
of Saint Thomas, in no fear of hell or devil, nor in any hope of reward
in heaven, or on earth; rarely indeed without any feeling of a God
taking notice, or belief in angels waiting near, have men or women
triumphed utterly over self. All history proves what man can sacrifice
on earth for an eternal weight of glory above. We know how cheerfully
men and women can sing at the stake, when they feel the fire consuming
them to be a chariot bearing them to heaven. We understand the valour
of Luther marching against his devils with his hymn, &lsquo;<span lang=
"de">Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott.</span>&rsquo; But it is important
to know what man&rsquo;s high heart is capable of without any of these
encouragements or aids, what man&rsquo;s moral force when he feels
himself alone. For this must become an increasingly momentous
consideration.</p>
<p>Already the educated youth of our time have followed the wanderer of
threescore years ago into that St. Thomas d&rsquo;Enfer Street, which
may be morally translated as the point where man doubts every hell he
does not feel, and every creed he cannot prove. The old fears and hopes
are fading faster from the minds around us than from their professions.
There must be very few sane people now who are restrained by fear of
hell, or promises of future reward. What then controls human passion
and selfishness? For many, custom; for others, hereditary good nature
and good sense; for some, a sense of honour; for multitudes, the fear
of law and penalties. It is very difficult indeed, amid these complex
motives, to know how far simple human nature, acting at its best, is
capable of heroic endurance for truth, and of pure passion for the
right. This cannot be seen in those who intellectually reject the creed
of the majority, but conform to its standards and pursue its worldly
advantages. It must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204"
name="pb204">204</a>]</span>be seen, if at all, in those who are
radically severed from the conventional aims of the world,&mdash;who
seek not its wealth, nor its honours, decline its proudest titles, defy
its authority, share not its prospects for time or eternity. It must be
proved by those, the grandeur of whose aims can change the splendours
of Paris to a wilderness. These may show what man, as man, is capable
of, what may be his new birth, and the religion of his simple manhood.
What they think, say, and do is not prescribed either by human or
supernatural command; in them you do not see what society thinks, or
sects believe, or what the populace applaud. You see the individual man
building his moral edifice, as genuinely as birds their nests, by law
of his own moral constitution. It is a great thing to know what those
edifices are, for so at last every man will have to build if he build
at all. And if noble lives cannot be so lived, we may be sure the
career of the human race will be downhill henceforth. For any unbiassed
mind may judge whether the tendency of thought and power lies toward or
away from the old hopes and fears on which the regime of the past was
founded.</p>
<p>A great and wise Teacher of our time, who shared with Carlyle his
lonely pilgrimage, has admonished his generation of the temptations
brought by talent,&mdash;selfish use of it for ambitious ends on the
one hand, or withdrawal into fruitless solitude on the other; and I
cannot forbear closing this chapter with his admonition to his young
countrymen forty years ago.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4561src" href=
"#xd26e4561" name="xd26e4561src">5</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Public and private avarice makes the air we breathe thick and
fat. The scholar is decent, indolent, complacent. See already the
tragic consequence. The mind <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>of this country, taught to aim at
low objects, eats upon itself. There is no work for any but the
decorous and the complacent. Young men of the fairest promise, who
begin life upon our shores, inflated by the mountain winds, shined upon
by all the stars of God, find the earth below not in unison with
these,&mdash;but are hindered from action by the disgust which the
principles on which business is managed inspire and turn drudges, or
die of disgust,&mdash;some of them suicides. What is the remedy? They
did not yet see, and thousands of young men as hopeful, now crowding to
the barriers for the career, do not yet see, that if the single man
plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide, the huge
world will come round to him. Patience&mdash;patience;&mdash;with the
shades of all the good and great for company; and for solace, the
perspective of your own infinite life; and for work, the study and the
communication of principles, the making those instincts prevalent, the
conversion of the world. Is it not the chief disgrace in the
world&mdash;not to be an unit; not to be reckoned one character; not to
yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear,&mdash;but
to be reckoned in the gross, in the hundred, in the thousand of the
party, the section, to which we belong; and our opinion predicted
geographically, as the north or the south? Not so, brothers and
friends,&mdash;please God, ours shall not be so. We will walk on our
own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own
minds.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=

<p class="first">In a Hindu myth, Dhrubo, an infant devotee, passed
much time in a jungle, surrounded by ferocious beasts, in devotional
exercises of such extraordinary merit that Vishnu erected a new heaven
for him as the reward of his piety. Vishnu even left his own happy
abode to superintend the construction of this special heaven. In Hebrew
mythology the favourite son, the chosen people, is called out of Egypt
to dwell in a new home, a promised land, not in heaven but on earth.
The idea common to the two is that of a contrast between a natural and
a celestial environment,&mdash;a jungle and beasts, bondage and
distress; a new heaven, a land flowing with milk and honey,&mdash;and
the correspondence with these of the elect child, Dhrubo or Israel.</p>
<p>The tendency of Christ&rsquo;s mind appears to have been rather in
the Aryan direction; he pointed his friends to a kingdom not of this
world, and to his Father&rsquo;s many mansions in heaven. But the
Hebrew faith in a messianic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>reign in this world was too strong
for his dream; a new earth was appended to the new heaven, and became
gradually paramount, but this new earth was represented only by the
small society of believers who made the body of Christ, the members in
which his blood flowed.</p>
<p>That great cauldron of confused superstitions and mysticisms which
the Roman Empire became after the overthrow of Jerusalem, formed a
thick scum which has passed under the vague name of Gnosticism. The
primitive notions of all races were contained in it, however, and they
gathered in the second and third centuries a certain consistency in the
system of the Ophites. In the beginning existed <i>Bythos</i> (the
Depth); his first emanation and consort is <i>Ennoia</i> (Thought);
their first daughter is <i>Pneuma</i> (Spirit), their second
<i>Sophia</i> (Wisdom). Sophia&rsquo;s emanations are two&mdash;one
perfect, Christos; the other imperfect, Sophia-Achamoth,&mdash;who
respectively guide all that proceed from God and all that proceed from
Matter. Sophia, unable to act directly upon anything so gross as Matter
or unordered as Chaos, employs her imperfect daughter Sophia-Achamoth
for that purpose. But she, finding delight in imparting life to inert
Matter, became ambitious of creating in the abyss a world for herself.
To this end she produced the Demiurgus Ildabaoth (otherwise Jehovah) to
be creator of the material world. After this Sophia-Achamoth shook off
Matter, in which she had become entangled; but Ildabaoth (&lsquo;son of
Darkness&rsquo;) proceeded to produce emanations corresponding to those
of Bythos in the upper universe. Among his creations was Man, but his
man was a soulless monster crawling on the ground. Sophia-Achamoth
managed to transfer to Man the small ray of divine light which
Ildabaoth had inherited from her. The &lsquo;primitive Man&rsquo;
became thus a divine being. Ildabaoth, now entirely evil, was enraged
at having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>produced a being who had become superior to
himself, and his envy took shape in a serpent-formed Satan,
<i>Ophiomorphos</i>. He is the concentration of all that is most base
in Matter, conjoined with a spiritual intelligence. Their anti-Judaism
led the Ophites to identify Ildabaoth as Jehovah, and this serpent-son
of his as Michael; they also called him Sama&euml;l. Ildabaoth then
also created the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, with all
their evils. Resolving to confine man within his own lower domain, he
forbade him to eat of the Tree of Knowledge. To defeat his scheme,
which had all been evolved out of her own temporary fall,
Sophia-Achamoth sent her own genius, also in form of a serpent, Ophis,
to induce Man to transgress the tyrant&rsquo;s command. Eve supposing
Ophis the same as Ophiomorphos, regarded the prohibition against the
fruit as withdrawn and readily ate of it. Man thus became capable of
understanding heavenly mysteries, and Ildabaoth made haste to imprison
him in the dungeon of Matter. He also punished Ophis by making him eat
dust, and this heavenly serpent, contaminated by Matter, changed from
Man&rsquo;s friend to his foe. Sophia-Achamoth has always striven
against these two Serpents, who bind man to the body by corrupt
desires; she supplied mankind with divine light, through which they
became sensible of their nakedness&mdash;the misery of their condition.
Ildabaoth&rsquo;s seductive agents gained control over all the
offspring of Adam except Seth, type of the Spiritual Man.
Sophia-Achamoth moved Bythos to send down her perfect brother Christos
to aid the Spiritual Race of Seth. Christos descended through the seven
planetary regions, assuming <span class="corr" id="xd26e4604" title=
"Source: sucessively">successively</span> forms related to each, and
entered into the man Jesus at the moment of his baptism. Ildabaoth,
discovering him, stirred up the Jews to put him to death; but Christos
and Sophia, abandoning the material <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>body of Jesus on the
cross, gave him one made of ether. Hence his mother and disciples could
not recognise him. He ascended to the Middle Space, where he sits by
the right hand of Ildabaoth, though unperceived by the latter, and,
putting forth efforts for purification of mankind corresponding to
those put forth by Ildabaoth for evil, he is collecting all the
Spiritual elements of the world into the kingdom which is to overthrow
that of the Enemy.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4609src" href=
"#xd26e4609" name="xd26e4609src">1</a></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the animosity shown by the Ophites towards the Jews,
most of the elements in their system are plagiarised from the Jews.
According to ancient rabbinical traditions, Adam and Eve, by eating the
fruit of the lowest region, fell through the six regions to the seventh
and lowest; they were there brought under control of the previously
fallen Sama&euml;l, who defiled them with his spittle. Their nakedness
consisted in their having lost a natural protection of which only our
finger-nails are left; others say they lost a covering of
hair.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4614src" href="#xd26e4614" name=
"xd26e4614src">2</a> The Jews also from of old contended that Seth was
the son of Adam, in whom returned the divine nature with which man was
originally endowed. We have, indeed, only to identify Ildabaoth with
Elohim instead of Jehovah to perceive that the Ophites were following
Jewish precedents in attributing the natural world to a fiend. The link
between, the two conceptions may be discovered in the writings of
Paul.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s pessimistic conception of this world and of human
nature was radical, and it mainly formed the mould in which dogmatic
Christianity subsequently took <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210"
href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>shape. His general theology
is a travesty of the creation of the world and of man. All that work of
Elohim was, by implication, natural, that is to say, diabolical. The
earth as then created belonged to the Prince of this world, who was the
author of sin, and its consequence, death. In Adam all die. The natural
man is enmity against God; he is of the earth earthy; his father is the
devil; he cannot know spiritual things. All mankind are born
spiritually dead. Christ is a new and diviner Demiurgos, engaged in the
work of producing a new creation and a new man. For his purpose the old
law, circumcision or uncircumcision, are of no avail or importance, but
a new creature. His death is the symbol of man&rsquo;s death to the
natural world, his resurrection of man&rsquo;s rising into a new world
which mere flesh and blood cannot inherit. As God breathed into
Adam&rsquo;s nostrils the breath of life, the Spirit breathes upon the
elect of Christ a new mind and new heart.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;new creature&rsquo; must inhale an entirely new physical
atmosphere. When Paul speaks of &lsquo;the Prince of the Power of the
Air,&rsquo; it must not be supposed that he is only metaphorical. On
this, however, we must dwell for a little.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The air,&rsquo; writes Burton in his &lsquo;Anatomy of
Melancholy,&rsquo; &lsquo;The air is not so full of flies in summer as
it is at all times of invisible devils. They counterfeit suns and
moons, and sit on ships&rsquo; masts. They cause whirlwinds of a
sudden, and tempestuous storms, which though our meteorologists
generally refer to natural causes, yet I am of Bodine&rsquo;s mind,
they are more often caused by those aerial devils in their several
quarters. Cardan gives much information concerning them. His father had
one of them, an aerial devil, bound to him for eight and twenty years;
as Agrippa&rsquo;s dog had a devil tied to his collar. Some think that
Paracelsus had one confined in his sword pommel. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>Others wear them in rings;&rsquo; and so the old
man runs on, speculating about the mysterious cobwebs collected in the
ceiling of his brain.</p>
<p>The atmosphere mentally breathed by Burton and his authorities was
indeed charged with invisible phantasms; and every one of them was in
its origin a genuine intellectual effort to interpret the phenomena of
nature. It is not wonderful that the ancients should have ascribed to a
diabolical source the subtle deaths that struck at them from the air. A
single breath of the invisible poison of the air might lay low the
strongest. Even after man had come to understand his visible foes, the
deadly animal or plant, he could only cower and pray before the lurking
power of miasma and infection, the power of the air. The Tyndalls of a
primitive time studied dust and disease, and called the winged seeds of
decay and death &lsquo;aerial devils,&rsquo; and prepared the way for
Mephistopheles (devil of <i>smells</i>), as he in turn for the
<i>bacterial</i> demon of modern science.</p>
<p>There were not wanting theologic explanations why these malignant
beings should find their dwelling-place in the air. They had been
driven out of heaven. The etherial realm above the air was reserved for
the good. Of the demons the Hindus say, &lsquo;Their feet touch not the
ground.&rsquo; &lsquo;What man of virtue is there,&rsquo; said Titus to
his soldiers, &lsquo;who does not know that those souls which are
severed from their fleshy bodies in battles by the sword are received
by the &aelig;ther&mdash;that purest of elements&mdash;and joined to
that company which are placed among the stars; that they become gods,
d&aelig;mons, and propitious heroes, and show themselves as such to
their posterity afterwards?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4638src"
href="#xd26e4638" name="xd26e4638src">3</a> Malignant spirits were
believed to hold a more undisputed sway over the atmosphere than over
the earth, although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>our planet was mainly in their power, and
the subjects of the higher empire always a small colony.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4643src" href="#xd26e4643" name="xd26e4643src">4</a>
Moreover, there was a natural tendency of demons, which originally
represented earthly evils, when these were conquered by human
intelligence, to pass into the realm least accessible to science or to
control by man. The uncharted winds became their refuge.</p>
<p>This belief was general among the Christian Fathers,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4648src" href="#xd26e4648" name="xd26e4648src">5</a>
lasted a very long time even among the educated, and is still the
teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, as any one may see by reading
the authorised work of Mgr. Gaume on &lsquo;Holy Water&rsquo; (p. 305).
So long as it was admitted among thinking people that the mind was as
competent to build facts upon theory as theories on fact, a great deal
might be plausibly said for this atmospheric diabolarchy. In the days
when witchcraft was first called in question, Glanvil argued
&lsquo;that since this little Spot is so thickly peopled in every Atome
of it, &rsquo;tis weakness to think that all the vast spaces Above and
hollows under Ground are desert and uninhabited,&rsquo; and he
anticipated that, as microscopic science might reveal further
populations in places seemingly vacant, it would necessitate the belief
that the regions of the upper air are inhabited.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4651src" href="#xd26e4651" name="xd26e4651src">6</a> Other
learned men concluded that the spirits that lodge there are such as are
clogged with earthly elements; the baser sort; dwelling in cold air,
they would like to inhabit the more sheltered earth. In repayment for
broth, and various dietetic horrors proffered them by witches, they
enable them to pass freely through their realm&mdash;the air.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span></p>
<p>Out of such intellectual atmosphere came Paul&rsquo;s sentence
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%202:2&amp;version=NRSV">Eph.
ii. 2</a>) about &lsquo;the Prince of the Power of the Air.&rsquo; It
was a spiritualisation of the existing aerial demonology. When Paul and
his companions carried their religious agitation into the centres of
learning and wealth, and brought the teachings of a Jew to confront the
temples of Greece and Rome, they found themselves unrelated to that
great world. It had another habit of mind and feeling, and the idea
grew in him that it was the spirits of the Satanic world counteracting
the spirit sent on earth from the divine world. This animated its
fashions, philosophy, science, and literature. He warns the Church at
Ephesus that they will need the whole armour of God, because they are
wrestling not with mere flesh and blood, but against the rulers of the
world&rsquo;s darkness, the evil spirits in high places&mdash;that is,
in the Air.</p>

<p>As heirs of this new nature and new world, with its new atmosphere,
purchased and endowed by Christ, the Pauline theory further
presupposes, that the natural man, having died, is buried with Christ
in baptism, rises with him, and is then sealed to him by the Holy
Ghost. For a little time such must still bear about them their fleshy
bodies, but soon Christ shall come, and these vile bodies shall be
changed into his likeness; meanwhile they must keep their bodies in
subjection, even as Paul did, by beating it black and blue
(<span class="trans" title="hyp&#333;piaz&#333;"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"grc">&#8017;&pi;&omega;&pi;&iota;&#8049;&zeta;&omega;</span></span>),
and await their deliverance from the body of the dead world they have
left, but which so far is permitted to adhere to them. This conception
had to work itself out in myths and dogmas of which Paul knew nothing.
&lsquo;If any man come after me and hate not his father and mother, and
his own (natural) life also, he cannot be my disciple.&rsquo; The new
race with which the new creation was in travail was logically
discovered to need a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"
name="pb214">214</a>]</span>new Mother as well as a new Father. Every
natural mother was subjected to a stain that it might be affirmed that
only one mother was immaculate&mdash;she whose conception <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>was
supernatural, not of the flesh. Marriage became an indulgence to sin
(whose purchase-money survives still in the marriage-fee). The
monastery and the nunnery represented this new ascetic kingdom; that
perilous word &lsquo;worldliness&rsquo; was transmitted to be the
source of insanity and hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Happily, the common sense and sentiment of mankind have so steadily
and successfully won back the outlawed interests of life and the world,
that it requires some research into ecclesiastical arch&aelig;ology to
comprehend the original significance of the symbols in which it
survives. The ancient rabbins limited the number of souls which hang on
Adam to 600,000, but the Christian theologians extended the figures to
include the human race. Probably even some orthodox people may be
scandalised at the idea of the fathers (Iren&aelig;us, for example),
that, at the Fall, the human race became Satan&rsquo;s rightful
property, did they see it in the picture copied by Buslaef, from an
ancient Russian Bible, in possession of Count Uvarof. Adam gives Satan
a written contract for himself and his descendants (<a href=
"#fig07">Fig. 7</a>). And yet, according to a recent statement, the
Rev. Mr. Simeon recently preached a sermon in the Church of St.
Augustine, Kilburn, London, &lsquo;to prove that the ruler of the world
is the devil. He stated that the Creator of the world had given the
control of the world to one of his chief angels, Lucifer, who, however,
had gone to grief, and done his utmost to ruin the world. Since then
the Creator and Lucifer had been continually striving to checkmate each
other. As Lucifer is still the Prince of this world, it would seem that
it is not he who has been beaten yet.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4686src" href="#xd26e4686" name="xd26e4686src">7</a> A popular
preacher in America, Rev. Dr. Talmage, states the case as
follows:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216"
name="pb216">216</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I turn to the same old book, and I find out that the Son of
Mary, who was the Son of God, the darling of heaven, the champion of
the ages, by some called Lord, by some called Jesus, by others called
Christ, but this morning by us called by the three blessed titles, Lord
Jesus Christ, by one magnificent stroke made it possible for us all to
be saved. He not only told us that there was a hell, but he went into
it. He walked down the fiery steeps. He stepped off the bottom rung of
the long ladder of despair. He descended into hell. He put his bare
foot on the hottest coal of the fiercest furnace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He explored the darkest den of eternal midnight, and then He
came forth lacerated and scarified, and bleeding and mauled by the
hands of infernal excruciation, to cry out to all the ages, &lsquo;I
have paid the price for all those who would make me their substitute.
By my piled-up groans, by my omnipotent agony, I demand the rescue of
all those who will give up sin and trust in me,&rsquo; Mercy! mercy!
mercy! But how am I to get it? Cheap. It will not cost you as much as a
loaf of bread. Only a penny? No, no. Escape from hell, and all the
harps, and mansions, and thrones, and sunlit fields of heaven besides
in the bargain, &lsquo;without money, and without
price.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>These preachers are only stating with creditable candour the
original significance of the sacraments and ceremonies which were the
physiognomy of that theory of &lsquo;a new creature.&rsquo; Following
various ancient traditions, that life was produced out of water, that
water escaped the primal curse on nature, that devils hate and fear it
because of this and the saltness of so much of it, many religions have
used water for purification and exorcism.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4696src" href="#xd26e4696" name="xd26e4696src">8</a> Baptism
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>is based on the notion that every child is
offspring of the Devil, and possessed of his demon; the Fathers agreed
that all unbaptized babes, even the still-born, are lost; and up to the
year 1550 every infant was subjected at baptism to the exorcism,
&lsquo;I command thee, unclean spirit, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>in the name of the
Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, that thou come out, and
depart from, these infants whom our Lord Jesus Christ has vouchsafed to
call to his holy baptism, to be made members of his body and of his
holy congregation,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>A clergyman informed me that he knew of a case in which a man,
receiving back his child after christening, kissed it, and said,
&lsquo;I never kissed it before, because I knew it was not a child of
God; but now that it is, I love it dearly.&rsquo; But why not? Some
even now teach that a white angel follows the baptized, a black demon
the unbaptized.</p>
<p>The belief was wide-spread that unbaptized children were turned into
elves at death. In Iceland it is still told as a bit of folk-lore, that
when God visited Eve, she kept a large number of her children out of
sight, &lsquo;because they had not been washed,&rsquo; and these
children were turned into elves, and became the progenitors of that
uncanny race. The Greek Church made so much of baptism, that there has
been developed an Eastern sect which claims John the Baptist as its
founder, making little of Christ, who baptized none; and to this day in
Russia the peasant regards it as almost essential to a right reception
of the benedictions of Sunday to have been under water on the previous
day&mdash;soap being sagaciously added. The Roman Catholic Church,
following the provision of the Council of Carthage, still sets a high
value on baptismal exorcism; and Calvin refers to a theological debate
at the Sorbonne in Paris, whether it would not be justifiable for a
priest to throw a child into a well rather than have it die unbaptized.
Luther preserved the Catholic form of exorcism; and, in some districts
of Germany, Protestants have still such faith in it, that, when either
a child or a domestic animal is suspected of being possessed, they will
send for the Romish priest to perform the rite of exorcism.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>Mr. Herbert Spencer has described the class of superstitions out of
which the sacrament of the Eucharist has grown. &lsquo;In some
cases,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;parts of the dead are swallowed by the
living, who seek thus to inspire themselves with the good qualities of
the dead; and we saw (&sect; 133) that the dead are supposed to be
honoured by this act. The implied notion was supposed to be associated
with the further notion that the nature of another being, inhering in
all the fragments of his body, inheres too in the unconsumed part of
anything consumed with his body; so that an operation wrought on the
remnants of his food becomes an operation wrought on the food
swallowed, and therefore on the swallower. Yet another implication is,
that between those who swallow different parts of the same food some
community of nature is established. Hence such beliefs as that ascribed
by Bastian to some negroes, who think that, &lsquo;on eating and
drinking consecrated food, they eat and drink the god
himself&rsquo;&mdash;such god being an ancestor, who has taken his
share. Various ceremonies among savages are prompted by this
conception; as, for instance, the choosing a totem. Among the Mosquito
Indians, &lsquo;the manner of obtaining this guardian was to proceed to
some secluded spot and offer up a sacrifice: with the beast or bird
which thereupon appeared, in dream or in reality, a compact for life
was made, by drawing blood from various parts of the body.&rsquo; This
blood, supposed to be taken by the chosen animal, connected the two,
and the animal&rsquo;s life became so bound up with their own that the
death of one involved that of the other.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4722src" href="#xd26e4722" name="xd26e4722src">9</a> And now mark
that, in these same regions, this idea <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb220" href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>reappears as a
religious observance. Sahagun and Herrera describe a ceremony of the
Aztecs called &lsquo;eating the god.&rsquo; Mendieta, describing this
ceremony, says, &lsquo;They had also a sort of
eucharist&#8202;&hellip;. They made a sort of small idols of seeds,
&hellip; and ate them as the body or memory of their gods.&rsquo; As
the seeds were cemented partly by the blood of sacrificed boys; as
their gods were cannibal gods; as Huitzilopochtli, whose worship
included this rite, was the god to whom human sacrifices were most
extensive; it is clear that the aim was to establish community with
gods by taking blood in common.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4738src" href="#xd26e4738" name="xd26e4738src">10</a></p>
<p>When, a little time ago, a New Zealand chief showed his high
appreciation of a learned German by eating his eyes to improve his own
intellectual vision, the case seemed to some to call for more and
better protected missionaries; but the chief might find in the
sacramental communion of the missionaries the real principle of his
faith. The celebration of the &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;s Supper&rsquo; when a
Bishop is ordained has only to be &lsquo;scratched,&rsquo; as the
proverb says, to reveal beneath it the Indians choosing their episcopal
totem. As Israel observed the Passover&mdash;eating together of the
lamb whose blood sprinkled on their door-posts had marked those to be
preserved from the Destroying Angel in Egypt&mdash;they who believed
that Jesus was Messias tasted the body and blood of their Head, as
indicating the elect out of a world otherwise given over to the
Destroyer spiritually, and finally to be delivered up to him bodily.
&lsquo;He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>dwelleth in me and I in him.&rsquo; These were
to tread on serpents, or handle them unharmed, as it is said Paul
did<span class="corr" id="xd26e4748" title="Not in source">.</span>
They were not really to die, but to fall asleep, that they might be
changed as a seed to its flower, through literal resurrection from the
earth.</p>
<p>We should probably look in vain after any satisfactory vestiges of
the migration of the superstition concerning the mystical potency of
food. It is found fully developed in the ancient Hindu myth of the
struggle between the gods and demons for the Amrita, the immortalising
nectar, one stolen sip of which gave the monster R&aacute;hu the
imperishable nature which no other of his order possesses. It is found
in corresponding myths concerning the gods of Asgard and of Olympus.
The fall of man in the Iranian legend was through a certain milk given
by Ahriman to the first pair, Meschia and Meschiane. In Buddhist
mythology, it was eating rice that corrupted the nature of man. It was
the process of incarnation in the Gilghit legend (i. 398). The whole
story of Persephone turns upon her having eaten the seed of a
pomegranate in Hades, by which she was bound to that sphere. There is a
myth very similar to that of Persephone in Japan. There is a legend in
the Scottish Highlands that a woman was conveyed into the secret
recesses of the &lsquo;men of peace&rsquo;&mdash;the Daoine Shi&rsquo;,
euphemistic name of uncanny beings, who carry away mortals to their
subterranean apartments, where beautiful damsels tempt them to eat of
magnificent banquets. This woman on her arrival was recognised by a
former acquaintance, who, still retaining some portion of human
benevolence, warned her that, if she tasted anything whatsoever for a
certain space of time, she would be doomed to remain in that underworld
for ever. The woman having taken this counsel, was ultimately restored
to the society of mortals. It was added that, when the period named by
her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=

of this woman&rsquo;s eyes took place, and the viands which had before
seemed so tempting she now discovered to consist only of the refuse of
the earth.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4755src" href="#xd26e4755" name=

<p>The difficulty of tracing the ethnical origin of such legends as
these is much greater than that of tracing their common natural origin.
The effect of certain kinds of food upon the human system is very
marked, even apart from the notorious effects of the drinks made from
the vegetative world. The effects of mandrake, opium, tobacco, various
semi-poisonous fungi, the simplicity with which differences of race
might be explained by their vegetarian or carnivorous customs, would be
enough to suggest theories of the potency of food over the body and
soul of man such as even now have their value in scientific
speculation.</p>
<p>The Jewish opinion that Seth was the offspring of the divine part of
Adam was the germ of a remarkable christian myth. Adam, when dying,
desired Seth to procure the oil of mercy (for his extreme unction) from
the angels guarding Paradise. Michael informs Seth that it can only be
obtained after the lapse of the ages intervening the Fall and the
Atonement. Seth received, however, a small branch of the Tree of
Knowledge, and was told that when it should bear fruit, Adam would
recover. Returning, Seth found Adam dead, and planted the branch in his
grave. It grew to a tree which Solomon had hewn down for building the
temple; but the workmen could not adapt it, threw it aside, and it was
used as a bridge over a lake. The Queen of Sheba, about to cross this
lake, beheld a vision of Christ on the cross, and informed Solomon that
when a certain person had been suspended on that tree the fall of the
Jewish nation would be near. Solomon in alarm buried the wood deep in
the earth, and the spot was covered by the pool of Bethesda. Shortly
before the crucifixion the tree floated on that water, and ultimately,
as the cross, bore its fruit.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4770src" href=
"#xd26e4770" name="xd26e4770src">12</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>In our old Russian picture (<a href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a>) Seth is
shown offering a branch of the Tree of Knowledge to his father Adam.
That it should spring up to be the Tree of Life is simply in obedience
to Magian and Gnostic theories, which generally turn on some scheme by
which the Good turns against the Evil Mind the point of his own weapon.
These were the influences which gave to christian doctrines on the
subject their perilous precision. The universal tradition was that Adam
was the first person liberated by Christ from hell; and this
corresponded with an equally wide belief that all who were saved by the
death of Christ and his descent into hell were at once raised into the
moral condition of Adam and Eve before the Fall,&mdash;to eat the food
and breathe the holy air of Paradise.</p>
<p>An honest mirror was held up before this theology by the christian
Adamites. Their movement (second and third centuries) was a most
legitimate outcome of the Pauline and Johannine gospel. The author of
this so-called &lsquo;heresy,&rsquo; Prodicus, really anticipated the
Methodist doctrine of &lsquo;sanctification,&rsquo; and he was only
consistent in admonishing his followers that clothing was, in the
Bible, the original badge of carnal guilt and shame, and was no longer
necessary for those whom Christ had redeemed from the Fall and raised
to the original innocence of Adam and Eve. These believers, in the
appropriate climate of Northern Africa, had no difficulty in carrying
out their doctrine practically, and having named their churches
&lsquo;Paradises,&rsquo; assembled in them quite naked. There is still
a superstition in the East that a snake will never attack one who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>is naked. The same Adamite doctrine&mdash;a
prelapsarian perfection symbolised by nudity&mdash;was taught by John
Picard in Bohemia, and a flourishing sect of &lsquo;Adamites&rsquo;
arose there in the fifteenth century. The Slavonian Adamites of the
last century&mdash;and they are known to carry on their services still
in secret&mdash;not only dispense with clothing, but also with
sacraments and ceremonies, which are for the imperfect, not for the
perfected. Again and again has this logical result of the popular
theology appeared, and with increasingly gross circumstances, as the
refined and intelligent abandon except in name the corresponding
dogmas. It is an impressive fact that Paul&rsquo;s central doctrine of
&lsquo;a new creature&rsquo; is now adopted with most realistic
orthodoxy by the Mormons of Utah, whose initiation consists of a
dramatic performance on each candidate of moulding the body out of
clay, breathing in the nostrils, the &lsquo;deep sleep&rsquo;
presentation of an Eve to each Adam, the temptation, fall, and
redemption. The &lsquo;saints&rsquo; thus made, unfortunately, seem to
have equally realistic ideas that the Gentiles are adherents of the
Prince of this world, and their sacramental bands have shown some
striking imitations of those events of history which, when not labelled
&lsquo;Christian,&rsquo; are pronounced barbarous. Now that the old
dogmatic system is being left more and more to the ignorant and vulgar
to make over into their own image and likeness, it may be hoped that
elsewhere also the error that libels and outrages nature will run to
seed; for error, like the aloe, has its period when it shoots up a high
stem and&mdash;dies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226"

<span lang="fr">&lsquo;L&rsquo;Eau Benite au Dix-neuvi&egrave;me
Si&egrave;cle.&rsquo; Par Monsignor Gaume, Protonotaire Apostolique.
Paris, 1866</span>. It is there stated that water escaped the curse;
that salt produces fecundity; that devils driven off temporarily by the
cross are effectually dismissed by holy water; that St. Vincent,
interrupted by a storm while preaching, dispersed it by throwing holy
water at it; and he advises the use of holy water against the latest
devices of the devil&mdash;spirit-rapping. It must not, however, be
supposed that these notions are confined to Catholics. Every element in
the disquisition of Monsignor Gaume is represented in the region where
his church is most hated. Mr. James Napier, in his recent book on
Folklore, shows us the Scotch hastening new-born babes to baptism lest
they become &lsquo;changelings,&rsquo; and the true meaning of the rite
is illustrated in a reminiscence of his own childhood. He was supposed
to be pining under an Evil Eye, and the old woman, or
&lsquo;skilly,&rsquo; called in, carefully locked the door, now
unlocked by her patient, and proceeded as follows:&mdash; &lsquo;A
sixpence was borrowed from a neighbour, a good fire was kept burning in
the grate, the door was locked, and I was placed upon a chair in front
of the fire. The operator, an old woman, took a tablespoon and filled
it with water. With the sixpence she then lifted as much salt as it
would carry, and both were put into the water in the spoon. The water
was then stirred with the forefinger till the salt was dissolved. Then
the soles of my feet and the palms of my hands were bathed with this
solution thrice, and after these bathings I was made to taste the
solution three times. The operator then drew her wet forefinger across
my brow&mdash;called <i>scoring aboon the breath</i>. The remaining
contents of the spoon she then cast right over the fire, into the
hinder part of the fire, saying as she did so, &lsquo;<i>Guid preserve
frae a&rsquo; skaith</i>.&rsquo; These were the first words permitted
to be spoken during the operation. I was then put in bed, and, in
attestation of the charm, recovered. To my knowledge this operation has
been performed within these forty years, and probably in many outlying
country places it is still practised. The origin of this superstition
is probably to be found in ancient fire-worship. The great blazing fire
was evidently an important element in the transaction; nor was this a
solitary instance in which regard was paid to the fire. I remember
being taught that it was unlucky to spit into the fire, some evil being
likely shortly after to befall those who did so. Crumbs left upon the
table after a meal were carefully gathered and put into the fire. The
cuttings from the nails and hair were also put into the fire. These
freaks certainly look like survivals of fire-worship.&rsquo; It may be
well here to refer the reader to what has been said in vol. i. on
Demons of Fire. The Devil&rsquo;s fear of salt and consequently of
water confirmed the perhaps earlier apprehension of all fiery phantoms
of that which naturally quenches flame.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is in the old town of Hanover, in Germany, a
schoolhouse in which, above the teacher&rsquo;s chair, there was
anciently the representation of a dove perched upon an iron branch or
rod; and beneath the inscription&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="sc">This
shall lead you into all truth.</span>&rsquo; In the course of time the
dove fell down and was removed to the museum; but there is still left
before the children the rod, with the admonition that it will lead them
into all truth. This is about as much as for a long time was left in
the average christian mind of the symbolical Dove, the Holy Ghost. Half
of its primitive sense departed, and there remained only an emblem of
mysterious terror. More spiritual minds have introduced into the modern
world a conception of the Holy Ghost as a life-giving influence or a
spirit of love, but the ancient view which regarded it as the Iron Rod
of judgment and execution still survives in the notion of the
&lsquo;sin against the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Henry G. Atkinson writes as follows:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4802src" href="#xd26e4802" name=
"xd26e4802src">1</a>&mdash;&lsquo;My old <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>friend Barry
Cornwall, the fine poet, once said to me, &lsquo;My dear Atkinson, can
you tell me the meaning of the Holy Ghost; what can it possibly
mean?&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I suppose it means a
pigeon. We have never heard of it in any other form but that of the
dove descending from heaven to the Virgin Mary. Then we have the pretty
fable of the dove returning to the ark with the olive-branch, so that
the Christian religion may be called the Religion of the Pigeon. In the
Greek Church the pigeon is held sacred. St. Petersburgh is swarming
with pigeons, but they are never killed or disturbed. I knew a lady
whose life was made wretched in the belief that she had sinned the
unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost, and neither priest nor
physician could persuade her out of the delusion, though in all other
respects she was quite sensible. She regarded herself as such a wretch
that she could not bear to see herself in the glass, and the
looking-glasses had all to be removed, and when she went to an hotel,
her husband had to go first and have the looking-glasses of the
apartments covered over. But what is the Holy Ghost&mdash;what is its
office? Sitting with Miss Martineau at her house at Ambleside one day,
a German lady, who spoke broken English, came in. She was a neighbour,
and had a large house and grounds, and kept fowls. &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;
she said, quite excited, &lsquo;the beast has taken off another chicken
(meaning the hawk). I saw it myself. The wretch! it came down just like
the Holy Ghost, and snatched off the chicken.&rsquo; How Miss Martineau
did laugh; but I don&rsquo;t know that this story throws much light
upon the subject, since it does but bring us back to the
pigeon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It would require a volume to explain fully all the problems
suggested in this brief note, but the more important facts may be
condensed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is difficult to show how far the natural characteristics and
habits of the dove are reflected in its wide-spread symbolism. Its
plaintive note and fondness for solitudes are indicated in the
Psalmist&rsquo;s aspiration, &lsquo;Oh that I had the wings of a dove,
then would I fly away and be at rest; lo, then would I wander far off,
and remain in the wilderness.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4812src" href="#xd26e4812" name="xd26e4812src">2</a> It is not a
difficult transition from this association with the wilderness to
investment with a relationship with the demon of the
wilderness&mdash;Azazel. So we find it in certain passages in Jeremiah,
where the word has been suppressed in the ordinary English version.
&lsquo;The land is desolate because of the fierceness of the
dove.&rsquo; &lsquo;Let us go again to our own people to avoid the
sword of the dove.&rsquo; &lsquo;They shall flee away every one for
fear of the sword of the dove.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4817src" href="#xd26e4817" name="xd26e4817src">3</a> In India its
lustres&mdash;blue and fiery&mdash;may have connected it with
azure-necked Siva.</p>
<p>The far-seeing and wonderful character of the pigeon as a carrier
was well known to the ancients. On Egyptian bas-reliefs priests are
shown sending them with messages. They appear in the branches of the
oaks of Dodona, and in old Russian frescoes they sometimes perch on the
Tree of Knowledge in paradise. It is said that, in order to avail
himself of this universal symbolism, Mohammed trained a dove to perch
on his shoulder. As the raven was said to whisper secrets to Odin, so
the dove was often pictured at the ear of God. In N&ocirc;tre Dame de
Chartres, its beak is at the ear of Pope Gregory the Great.</p>
<p>It passed&mdash;and did not have far to go&mdash;to be the familiar
of kings. It brought the chrism from heaven at the baptism of Clovis.
White doves came to bear the soul of Louis of Thuringia to heaven. The
dove surmounted the sceptre of Charlemagne. At the consecration of the
kings of France, after the ceremony of unction, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>white doves were let loose in the church. At the
consecration of a monarch in England, a duke bears before the sovereign
the sceptre with the dove.</p>
<p>By association with both ecclesiastical and political sovereignty,
it came to represent very nearly the old fatal serpent power which had
lurked in all its transformations. When the Holy Ghost was represented
as a crowned man, the dove was pictured on his wrist like that falcon
with which the German lady, mentioned by Mr. Atkinson, identified it.
But in this connection its symbolism is more especially referable to a
passage in Isaiah:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4836src" href=
"#xd26e4836" name="xd26e4836src">4</a> &lsquo;There shall come forth a
rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots;
and the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom
and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of the
knowledge and of the fear of the Lord.&rsquo; The sanctity of the
number seven led to the partition of the last clause into three
spirits, making up the seven, which were: Wisdom, Understanding,
Counsel, Strength, Knowledge, Piety, Fear. In some of the
representations of these where each of the seven Doves is labelled with
its name, &lsquo;Fear&rsquo; is at the top of their arch, a Psalm
having said, &lsquo;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom.&rsquo; When the knightly Order of the Holy Ghost was created in
1352, it was aristocratic, and, when reorganised by Henry III. of
France in 1579, it was restricted to magisterial and political
personages. With them was the spirit of Fear certainly; and the Order
shows plainly what had long been the ideas connected with the Holy
Ghost.</p>
<p>M. Didron finds this confirmed in the legends of every country, and
especially refers to a story of St. Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury,
in the tenth century. Three men, convicted of coining false money, had
been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>condemned to death. Immediately before the
celebration of mass on the day of Pentecost, the festival of the Holy
Ghost, St. Dunstan inquired whether justice had been done upon the
three criminals: he was informed in reply that the execution had been
delayed on account of the solemn feast of Pentecost then in
celebration. &lsquo;It shall not be thus,&rsquo; cried the indignant
archbishop, and gave orders for the immediate execution of the guilty
men. Several of those who were present remonstrated against the cruelty
of that order; it was nevertheless obeyed.</p>
<p>After the execution of the criminals, Dunstan washed his face, and
turned with a joyful countenance towards his oratory. &lsquo;I now
hope,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that God will be pleased to accept the
sacrifice I am about to offer;&rsquo; and in fact, during the
celebration of mass, at the moment when the Saint raised his hands to
implore that God the Father would be pleased to give peace to his
Church, to guide, guard, and keep it in unity throughout the world,
&lsquo;a dove, as white as snow, was seen to descend from heaven, and
during the entire service remained with wings extended, floating
silently in air above the head of the archbishop.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4848src" href="#xd26e4848" name=
"xd26e4848src">5</a></p>
<p>The passionate sexual nature of the dove made it emblem of
Aphrodite, and it became spiritualised in its consecration to the
Madonna. From its relation to the falsely-accused Mary, there grew
around the Dove a special class of legends which show it attesting
female innocence or avenging it. The white dove said to have issued
from the mouth of Joan of Arc is one of many instances. There is still,
I believe, preserved in the Lyttleton family the picture painted by
Dowager Lady <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>Lyttleton in 1780, in commemoration of the
warning of death given to Lord Lyttleton by the mother of two girls he
had seduced, the vision being attended by a fluttering dove. The
original account of his vision or dream, attributed to Lord Lyttleton,
mentions only &lsquo;a bird.&rsquo; When next told, it is that he
&lsquo;heard a noise resembling the fluttering of a dove,&rsquo; and on
looking to the window saw &lsquo;an unhappy female whom he had
seduced.&rsquo; But the exigencies of orthodoxy are too strong for
original narratives. As the &lsquo;bird&rsquo; attested an announcement
that on the third day (that too was gradually added) he would die, it
must have been a dove; and as the dove attends only the innocent, it
must have been the poor girl&rsquo;s mother that appeared. It was easy
to have the woman die at the precise hour of appearance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4855src" href="#xd26e4855" name="xd26e4855src">6</a>
When in Chicago in 1875, I read in one of the morning papers a very
particular account of how a white dove flew into the chamber window of
a young unmarried woman in a neighbouring village, she having brought
forth a child, and solemnly declaring that she had never lost her
virginity.</p>
<p>In this history of the symbolism of the Dove the theological
development of the Holy Ghost has been outlined. We have seen in the
previous chapter that the Holy Spirit is in opposition to the Natural
Air,&mdash;repository of evils. The Dove symbolised this aspect of it
in hovering over the world emerging from its diluvial baptism, and also
over the typical new Adam (Jesus) coming from his baptism. But in this
it corresponds with the serpent-symbol of life in Egyptian mythology
brooding over the primal mundane egg (as in Fig. 23, vol. i.).
Nathaniel Hawthorne found a mystical meaning in the beautiful group at
Rome representing a girl pressing a dove to her bosom while she is
attacked by a serpent. But in their theological aspects <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>the
Dove and the Serpent blend; they are at once related and separated in
Christ&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;Be ye wise as serpents and harmless as
doves;&rsquo; but in the office of the Holy Ghost as representing a
divine Intelligence, and its consequent evolution as executor of divine
judgments, it fulfils in Christendom much the same part as the Serpent
in the more primitive mythologies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven unto men,&rsquo;
said a legendary Christ;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4867src" href=
"#xd26e4867" name="xd26e4867src">7</a> &lsquo;but the blasphemy against
the Spirit will not be forgiven. And whosoever shall speak a word
against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him, but whosoever shall
speak against the Holy Ghost, it will not be forgiven him, neither in
this world nor in that to come.&rsquo; In Mark<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4872src" href="#xd26e4872" name="xd26e4872src">8</a> it is said,
&lsquo;All things shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, the sins and
the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme: but whosoever shall
blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness, but will be
guilty of everlasting sin; (because they said, He has an unclean
spirit).&rsquo; When Christ uttered these tremendous words, no disciple
seems to have been startled, or to have inquired into the nature of
that sin, so much worse than any offence against himself or the Father,
which has since employed so much theological speculation.</p>
<p>In fact, they needed no explanation: it was an old story; the
unpardonable sin was a familiar feature of ancient Jewish law. Therein
the sin excluded from expiation was any presumptuous language or action
against Jehovah. It is easy to see why this was so. Real offences,
crimes against man or society, were certain of punishment, through the
common interest and need. But the honour and interests of Jehovah, not
being obvious or founded in nature, required special and severe
statutes. The less a thing is protected by its intrinsic and practical
importance, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>the more it must, if at all, be artificially
protected. This is illustrated in the story of Eli and his two sons.
These youths were guilty of the grossest immoralities, but not a word
was said against them, they being sons of the High Priest, except a
mild remonstrance from Eli himself. But when on an occasion these
youths tasted the part of the sacrificial meat offered to Jehovah, the
divine wrath was kindled. Eli, much more terrified at this ceremonial
than the moral offence, said to his sons, &lsquo;If one man sin against
another, the judge shall judge him, but if a man sin against Jehovah,
who shall entreat for him?&rsquo; In protecting his interests,
Jehovah&rsquo;s destroying angel does not allude to any other offence
of Eli&rsquo;s sons except that against himself. But when the priestly
guardians of the divine interests came with their people under the
control of successive Gallios,&mdash;aliens who cared not for their
ceremonial law, and declined to permit the infliction of its penalties,
as England now forbids <i>suttee</i> in India,&mdash;the priests could
only pass sentences; execution of them had to be adjourned to a future
world.</p>
<p>The doctrine of a future state of rewards and punishments is not one
which a priesthood would naturally prefer or invent. So long as a
priesthood possesses the power of life and death over the human body,
they would not, by suggesting future awards, risk the possibility of a
heresy arising to maintain <i lang="la">Deorum injuria diis cura</i>.
But where an alien jurisdiction has relegated to local deities the
defence of their own majesty, there must grow up the theory that such
offences as cannot be expiated on earth are unpardonable, and must,
because of the legal impunity with which they can be committed, be all
the more terribly avenged somewhere else.</p>
<p>Under alien influences, also, the supreme and absolute government of
Jehovah had been divided, as is elsewhere <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>described. He who
originally claimed the empire of both light and darkness, good and
evil, when his rivalry against other gods was on a question of power,
had to be relieved of responsibility for earthly evils when the moral
sense demanded dualism. Thus there grew up a separate personification
of the destructive power of Jehovah, which had been supposed to lodge
in his breath. The last breath of man obviously ends life; there is
nothing more simple in its natural germ than the association of the
first breath and the last with the Creative Spirit.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4893src" href="#xd26e4893" name="xd26e4893src">9</a> This
potency of the breath or spirit is found in many ancient regions. It is
the natural teaching of the destructive simoom,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4896src" href="#xd26e4896" name="xd26e4896src">10</a> or even of
the annual autumnal breath which strikes the foliage with death. Persia
especially abounded with superstitions of this character. By a
sorcerer&rsquo;s breath the two serpents were evoked from the breast of
Zoh&aacute;k. Nizami has woven the popular notion into his story of the
two physicians who tried to destroy each other; one of whom survived
his rival&rsquo;s poisonous draught, and killed that rival by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>making him smell a flower on which he had
breathed.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4904src" href="#xd26e4904" name=
"xd26e4904src">11</a> Such notions as these influenced powerfully the
later development of the idea of Jehovah, concerning whom it was said
of old, &lsquo;With the breath of his mouth shall he slay the
wicked;&rsquo; &lsquo;the breath of the Lord like a stream of brimstone
doth kindle (Tophet).&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile in all the Trinitarian races which were to give form to
christian Mythology, destructiveness had generally (not invariably)
become the traditional r&ocirc;le of the Third Person.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4909src" href="#xd26e4909" name=
"xd26e4909src">12</a> In Egypt there were Osiris the Creator, Horus the
Preserver, Typhon the Destroyer; in Babylonia, Anu the Upper Air, Sin
(Uri) the Moon, Samis the Sun. In Assyria the Sun regains his place,
and deadly influences were ascribed to the Moon. In India, Brahma the
Father, Vishnu the Saviour, Siva the Destroyer; in Persia,
Zeru&acirc;ne-Akrane Infinite Time, Ormuzd the Good, Ahriman the Evil;
in Greece Zeus, Poseid&ocirc;n, and Had&ecirc;s, or Heaven, Ocean, and
Hell, were the first-born of Time. The Trinitarian form had gradually
crept in among the Jews, though their Jahvistic theology only admitted
its application to inferior deities&mdash;Cain, Abel, Seth; Moses,
Aaron, Hur; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob. As time went on, these succeeded the
ideas of Jehovah, Messias, and Wisdom. But already the serpent was the
wisest of all the beasts of the field in Jewish mythology; and the
personified Wisdom was fully prepared to be identified with Athene, the
Greek Wisdom, who sprang armed from the head of Zeus (the Air), and
whose familiar was a serpent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, the divine Breath had also its benign
significance. Siva (&lsquo;the auspicious&rsquo;) inherited
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>the character of Rudra (&lsquo;roaring
storm&rsquo;), but it was rather supported later on by his wife
K&aacute;li. Athena though armed was the goddess of agriculture. The
breath of Elohim had given man life. &lsquo;I now draw in and now let
forth,&rsquo; says Krishna;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4916src" href=
"#xd26e4916" name="xd26e4916src">13</a> &lsquo;I am generation and
dissolution; I am death and immortality.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou wilt fancy
it the dawning zephyr of an early spring,&rsquo; says S&agrave;di;
&lsquo;but it is the breath of Isa, or Jesus; for in that fresh breath
and verdure the dead earth is reviving.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4921src" href="#xd26e4921" name="xd26e4921src">14</a> &lsquo;The
voice of the turtle is heard in the land,&rsquo; sings Solomon.</p>
<p>When the Third Person of the Christian Trinity was constituted, it
inherited the fatality of all the previous Third Persons&mdash;the
Destroyers&mdash;while it veiled them in mystery. When the Holy Ghost
inspired the disciples the account is significant.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4926src" href="#xd26e4926" name="xd26e4926src">15</a>
&lsquo;Suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
wind, &hellip; and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of
fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the
Holy Ghost.&rsquo; This was on the Day of Pentecost, the harvest
festival, when the first-fruits were offered to the quickening Spirit
or Breath of nature; but the destructive feature is there
also&mdash;the tongues are cloven like those of serpents. The
beneficent power was manifest at the gate called Beautiful when the
lame man was made to walk by Peter&rsquo;s power; but its fatal power
was with the same apostle, and when he said, &lsquo;Why hath Satan
filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost?&rsquo; instantly Ananias
fell down and gave up the ghost.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4931src"
href="#xd26e4931" name="xd26e4931src">16</a> The spirit was carried, it
is said, in the breath of the apostles. Its awfulness had various
illustrations. Mary offered up two doves in token of her conception by
the Holy Ghost. Jesus is described <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237"
href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>as scourging from the temple
those that sold doves, and the allegory is repeated in Peter&rsquo;s
denunciation of Simon Magus, who offered money for the gift of the Holy
Ghost.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4939src" href="#xd26e4939" name=
"xd26e4939src">17</a></p>
<p>In one of his sermons Mr. Moody said, &lsquo;Nearly every day we
have somebody coming into the inquiry-room very much discouraged and
disheartened and cast down, because they think they have committed a
sin against the Holy Ghost, and that there is no hope for them.&rsquo;
Mr. Moody said he believed the sin was nearly impossible, but he adds
this remarkable statement, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember of ever
hearing a man swear by the Holy Ghost except once, and then I looked
upon him expecting him to fall dead, and my blood ran cold when I heard
him.&rsquo; But it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>is almost as rare to hear prayers addressed
to the Holy Ghost; and both phenomena&mdash;for praying and swearing
are radically related&mdash;are no doubt survivals of the ancient
notions which I have described. The forces of nature out of which the
symbol grew, the life that springs from death and grows by decay, is
essentially repeated again by those who adhere to the letter that
kills, and also by those who ascend with the spirit that makes alive.
It is probable that no more terrible form of the belief in a Devil
survives than this Holy Ghost Dogma, which, lurking in vagueness and
mystery, like the serpent of which it was born, passes by the
self-righteous to cast its shadows over the most sensitive and lowly
minds, chiefly those of pure women prone to exaggerate their least
blemishes.</p>
<p>In right reason the fatal Holy Ghost stands as the type of that Fear
by which priesthoods have been able to preserve their institutions
after the deities around whom they grew had become unpresentable, and
which could best be fostered beneath the veil of mystery. They who love
darkness rather than light because their deeds cannot bear the light,
veil their gods not to abolish them but to preserve them. Calvinism is
veiled, and Athanasianism, and Romanism; they are all veiled idols,
whose power lives by being hid in a mass of philology and casuistry. So
long as Christianity can persuade the Pope and Dr. Martineau, Dean
Stanley and Mr. Moody, Quakers, Shakers, Jumpers, all to describe
themselves alike as &lsquo;Christians,&rsquo; its real nature will be
veiled, its institutions will cumber the ground, and draw away the
strength and intellect due to humanity; the indefinable
&lsquo;infidel&rsquo; will be a devil. This process has been going on
for a long time. The serpent-god, accursed by the human mind which grew
superior to it, has crept into its Ark; but its fang and venom linger
with that Bishop breathing on a priest, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>priest breathing on a sick child, and bears down
side by side with science that atmosphere of mystery in which creep all
the old reptiles that throttle common sense and send their virus
<span class="corr" id="xd26e4957" title="Source: though">through</span>
all the social frame.</p>
<p>In demonology the Holy Ghost is not a Devil, but in it are reflected
the diabolisation of Culture and Progress and Art. It was these
&lsquo;Devils&rsquo; which compelled the gods to veil themselves
through successive ages, and to spiritualise their idols and dogmas to
save their institutions. The deities concealed have proved far more
potent over the popular imagination than when visible. The indefinable
terrible menace of the Holy Ghost was a consummate reply to that
equally indefinable spirit of loathing and contempt which rises among
the cultured and refined towards things that have become unreal, their
formalities and their cant. It is this ever-recurring necessity that
enables clergymen to denounce belief in Hell and a Devil in churches
which assuredly would never have been built but for the superstition so
denounced. The ancient beliefs and the present denunciation of them are
on the same thread,&mdash;the determination of a Church to survive and
hold its power at any and every cost. The jesuitical power to veil the
dogma is the most successful method of confronting the Spirit of an
Age, which in the eye of reason is the only holy spirit, but which to
ecclesiastical power struggling with enlightenment is the only
formidable Satan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240"

which the horrid wind I have before mentioned sweeps its consuming
blasts; it is called by the Turks <span class="sc">Samiel</span>, is
mentioned by the holy Job under the name of the East wind, and extends
its ravages all the way from the extreme end of the Gulf of Cambaya up
to Mosul; it carries along with it flakes of fire, like threads of
silk; instantly strikes dead those that breathe it, and consumes them
inwardly to ashes; the flesh soon becoming black as a coal, and
dropping off the bones. Philosophers consider it as a kind of electric
fire, proceeding from the sulphurous or nitrous exhalations which are
kindled by the agitations of the winds. The only possible means of
escape from its fatal effects is to fall flat on the ground, and
thereby prevent the drawing it in; to do this, however, it is necessary
first to see it, which is not always practicable.&rsquo;&nbsp;<a class=

the many survivals in civilised countries of these notions may be
noticed the belief that, in order to be free from a spell it is
necessary to draw blood from the witch above the breath, <i>i.e.</i>,
mouth and nostrils; to &lsquo;score aboon the breath&rsquo; is a
Scottish phrase. This probably came by the &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; route;
but it meets its christian kith and kin in the following story which I
find in a (MS.) Memorial sent to the House of Lords in 1869 by the Rev.
Thomas Berney, Rector of Bracon Ash, Diocese of Norwich:&mdash;&lsquo;I
was sent for in haste to privately baptize a child thought to be dying,
and belonging to parents who lived &lsquo;on the Common&rsquo; at
Hockering. It indeed appeared to be very ill, and its eyes were fixed,
and remarkably clouded and dull. Having baptized, I felt moved with a
longing desire to be enabled to heal the child; and I prayed very
earnestly to the Lord God Almighty to give me faith and strength to
enable me to do so. And I put my hands on its head and drew them down
on to its arms; and then breathed on its head three times, in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ. And as I held its arms and looked on it
anxiously, its face became exceedingly red and dark, and as the child
gradually assumed a natural colour, the eyes became clear again; and
then it gently closed its eyes in sleep. And I told the mother <i>not
to touch it any more till it awoke</i>; but to carry it up in the
cradle as it was. The next morning I found the child perfectly well.
She had not touched it, except at four in the morning to feed it, when
it seemed dead asleep, and it did not awake till ten
o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; This was written by an English Rector, and dated
from the Carlton Club! The italics are in the original MS. now before
me. The importance that no earthly hand should profanely touch the body
while the spirit was at work in it shows how completely systematised is
that insanity which consists of making a human mind an arena for the
survival of the unfittest.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<p class="first">In the &lsquo;Padma Purana&rsquo; it is recorded that
when King Vena embraced heretical doctrine and abjured the temples and
sacrifices, the people following him, seven powerful Rishis, high
priests, visited him and entreated him to return to their faith. They
said, &lsquo;These acts, O king, which thou art performing, are not of
our holy traditions, nor fit for our religion, but are such as shall be
performed by mankind at the entrance of Kali, the last and sinful age,
when thy new faith shall be received by all, and the service of the
gods be utterly relinquished.&rsquo; King Vena, being thus in advance
of his time, was burned on the sacred grass, while a mantra was
performed for him.</p>
<p>This theory of Kali is curious as indicating a final triumph of the
enemies of the gods. In the Scandinavian theory of
&lsquo;Ragnarok,&rsquo; the Twilight of the gods, there also seems to
have been included no hope of the future victory of the existing gods.
In the Pars&iacute; faith we first meet with the belief in a general
catastrophe followed by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>supremacy and universal sway of
good. This faith characterised the later Hebrew prophecies, and is the
spirit of Paul&rsquo;s brave saying, &lsquo;When all things shall be
subjected unto him, then also shall the Son himself be subject unto him
that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When, however, theology and metaphysics advanced and modelled this
fiery lava of prophetic and apostolic ages into dogmatic shapes, evil
was accorded an equal duration with good. The conflict between Christ
and his foes was not to end with the conversion or destruction of his
foes, but his final coming as monarch of the world was to witness the
chaining up of the Archfiend in the Pit.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s own idea of Satan, assuming certain reported
expressions to have been really uttered by him, must have been that
which regarded him as a Tempter to evil, whose object was to test the
reality of faith. &lsquo;Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked you for
himself, that he might sift you as the wheat; but I made supplication
for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when once thou hast returned,
confirm thy brethren. And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with
thee, both into prison and into death. And he said, I tell thee, Peter,
a cock will not crow this day till thou wilt thrice deny that thou
knowest me.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4983src" href=
"#xd26e4983" name="xd26e4983src">1</a> Such a sentiment could not
convey to Jewish ears a degraded notion of Satan, except as being a
nocturnal spirit who must cease his work at cock-crow. It is an
adaptation of what Jehovah himself was said to do, in the prophecy of
Amos. &lsquo;I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the
Lord&#8202;&hellip;. I will sift the house of Israel among all nations,
like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall
upon the earth.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4988src" href=

<p>Paul, too, appears to have had some such conception of Satan, since
he speaks of an evil-doer as delivered up to Satan &lsquo;for the
destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4996src" href="#xd26e4996" name="xd26e4996src">3</a>
There is, however, in another passage an indication of the distinctness
with which Paul and his friends had conceived a fresh adaptation of
Satan as obstacle of their work. &lsquo;For such,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves
into apostles of Christ. And no marvel: for Satan transforms himself
into an angel of light. It is no great thing therefore if his ministers
also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end will
be according to their works.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5001src"
href="#xd26e5001" name="xd26e5001src">4</a> It may be noted here that
Paul does not think of Satan himself as transforming himself to a
minister of righteousness, but of Satan&rsquo;s ministers as doing so.
It is one of a number of phrases in the New Testament which reveal the
working of a new movement towards an expression of its own. Real and
far-reaching religious revolutions in history are distinguished from
mere sectarian modifications, which they sum up in nothing more than in
their new phraseology. When Jehovah, Messias, and Satan are gradually
supplanted by Father, Christ, and Antichrist (or Man of Sin, False
Christ, Withholder (<span class="trans" title="katechon"><span class=
"Greek" lang=
"grc">&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#8051;&chi;&omicron;&nu;</span></span>),
False Prophet, Son of Perdition, Mystery of Iniquity, Lawless One), it
is plain that new elements are present, and new emergencies. These
varied phrases just quoted could not, indeed, crystallise for a long
time into any single name for the new Obstacle to the new life, for
during the same time the new life itself was too living, too various,
to harden in any definite shape or be marked with any special name. The
only New Testament writer who uses the word Antichrist is the so-called
Apostle John; and it is interesting to remark that it is by him
connected with a dogmatic statement of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>nature of Christ and definition of heresy.
&lsquo;Every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is
of God; and every spirit that confesses not Jesus is not of God: and
this is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it comes;
and now it is in the world already.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5016src" href="#xd26e5016" name="xd26e5016src">5</a> This
language, characteristic of the middle and close of the second
century,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5022src" href="#xd26e5022" name=
"xd26e5022src">6</a> is in strong contrast with Paul&rsquo;s utterance
in the first century, describing the Man of Sin (or of lawlessness, the
son of perdition), as one &lsquo;who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he sat in
the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5025src" href="#xd26e5025" name="xd26e5025src">7</a>
Christ has not yet begun to supplant God; to Paul he is the Son of God
confronting the Son of Destruction, the divine man opposed by the man
of sin. When the <i>nature</i> of Christ becomes the basis of a dogma,
the man of sin is at once defined as the opponent of that dogma.</p>
<p>As this dogma struggled on to its consummation and victory, it
necessarily took the form of a triumph over the C&aelig;sars, who were
proclaiming themselves gods, and demanding worship as such. The writer
of the second Epistle bearing Peter&rsquo;s name saw those christians
who yielded to such authority typified in Balaam, the erring prophet
who was opposed by the angel;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5035src" href=
"#xd26e5035" name="xd26e5035src">8</a> the writer of the Gospel of John
saw the traitor Judas as the &lsquo;son of perdition,&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5040src" href="#xd26e5040" name="xd26e5040src">9</a>
representing Jesus as praying that the rest of his disciples might be
kept &lsquo;out of the evil one;&rsquo; and many similar expressions
disclose the fact that, towards the close of the second century, and
throughout the third, the chief obstacle of those who were just
beginning to be called &lsquo;Christians&rsquo; was the temptation
offered by Rome to the christians themselves to betray their sect. It
was still a danger to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href=
"#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>name the very imperial gods who
successively set themselves up to be worshipped at Rome, but the
pointing of the phrases is unmistakable long before the last of the
pagan emperors held the stirrup for the first christian Pontiff to
mount his horse.</p>
<p>Nero had answered to the portrait of &lsquo;the son of perdition
sitting in the temple of God&rsquo; perfectly. He aspired to the title
&lsquo;King of the Jews.&rsquo; He solemnly assumed the name of
Jupiter. He had his temples and his priests, and shared divine honours
with his mistress Popp&aelig;a. Yet, when Nero and his glory had
perished under those phials of wrath described in the Apocalypse, a
more exact image of the insidious &lsquo;False Christ&rsquo; appeared
in Vespasian. His alleged miracles (&lsquo;lying wonders&rsquo;), and
the reported prediction of his greatness by a prophet on Mount Carmel,
his oppression of the Jews, who had to contribute the annual double
drachma to support the temples and gods which Vespasian had restored,
altogether made this decorous and popular emperor a more formidable
enemy than the &lsquo;Beast&rsquo; Nero whom he succeeded. The virtues
and philosophy of Marcus Aurelius still increased the danger. Political
conditions favoured all those who were inclined to compromise, and to
mingle the popular pagan and the Jewish festivals, symbols, and
ceremonies. In apocalyptic metaphor, Vespasian and Aurelius are the two
horns of the Lamb who spake like the Dragon, <i>i.e.</i>, Nero
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

<p>The beginnings of that mongrel of superstitions which at last gained
the name of Christianity were in the liberation, by decay of parts and
particles, of all those systems which Julius C&aelig;sar had caged
together for mutual destruction. &lsquo;With new thrones rise new
altars,&rsquo; says Byron&rsquo;s Sardanapalus; but it is still more
true that, with new thrones all altars crumble a little. At an early
period the differences <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href=
"#pb245" name="pb245">245</a>]</span>between the believers in Christ
and those they called idolaters were mainly in name; and, with the
increase of Gentile converts, the adoption of the symbolism and
practices of the old religions was so universal that the quarrel was
about originality. &lsquo;The Devil,&rsquo; says Tertullian,
&lsquo;whose business it is to pervert the truth, mimics the exact
circumstances of the Divine Sacraments in the mysteries of idols. He
himself baptizes some, that is to say, his believers and followers: he
promises forgiveness of sins from the <i>sacred fount</i>, and thus
initiates them into the religion of Mithras; he thus marks on the
forehead his own soldiers: he then celebrates the <i>oblation of
bread</i>; he brings in the symbol of resurrection, and wins the crown
with the sword.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5065src" href=
"#xd26e5065" name="xd26e5065src">10</a></p>
<p>What masses of fantastic nonsense it was possible to cram into one
brain was shown in the time of Nero, the brain being that of Simon the
Magician. Simon was, after all, a representative man; he reappears in
christian Gnosticism, and Peter, who denounced him, reappears also in
the phrenzy of Montanism. Take the followers of this Sorcerer
worshipping his image in the likeness of Jupiter, the Moon, and
Minerva; and Montanus with his wild <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>women Priscilla and
Maximilla going about claiming to be inspired by the Holy Ghost to
re-establish Syrian orthodoxy and asceticism; and we have fair
specimens of the parties that glared at each other, and apostrophised
each other as children of Belial. They competed with each other by
pretended miracles. They both claimed the name of Christ, and all the
approved symbols and sacraments. The triumph of one party turned the
other into Antichrist.</p>
<p>Thus in process of time, as one hydra-head fell only to be followed
by another, there was defined a Spirit common to and working through
them all&mdash;a new devil, whose special office was hostility to
Christ, and whose operations were through those who claimed to be
christians as well as through open enemies.</p>
<p>As usual, when the phrases, born of real struggles, had lost their
meaning, they were handed up to the theologians to be made into
perpetual dogmas. Out of an immeasurable mass of theories and
speculations, we may regard the following passage from Jerome as
showing what had become the prevailing belief at the beginning of the
fifth century. &lsquo;Let us say that which all ecclesiastical writers
have handed down, viz., that at the end of the world, when the Roman
Empire is to be destroyed, there will be ten kings, who will divide the
Roman world among them; and there will arise an eleventh little king
who will subdue three of the ten kings, that is, the king of Egypt, of
Africa, and of Ethiopia; and on these having been slain, the seven
other kings will submit.&rsquo; &lsquo;And behold,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;in the ram were the eyes of a man&rsquo;&mdash;this is that we
may not suppose him to be a devil or a d&aelig;mon, as some have
thought, but a man in whom Satan will dwell utterly and
bodily&mdash;&lsquo;and a mouth speaking great things;&rsquo; for he is
the &lsquo;man of sin, the son of perdition, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>who
sitteth in the temple of God making himself as God.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5082src" href="#xd26e5082" name=
"xd26e5082src">11</a></p>
<p>The &lsquo;Little Horn&rsquo; of Daniel has proved a cornucopia of
Antichrists. Not only the christians but the Jews and the mussulmans
have definite beliefs on the subject. The rabbinical name for
Antichrist is Armillus, a word found in the Targum (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa%2011:4&amp;version=NRSV">Isa.
xi. 4</a>): &lsquo;By the word of his mouth the wicked Armillus shall
die.&rsquo; There will be twelve signs of the Messiah&rsquo;s
coming&mdash;appearance of three apostate kings, terrible heat of the
sun, dew of blood, healing dew, the sun darkened for thirty days,
universal power of Rome with affliction for Jews, and the appearance of
the first Messias (Joseph&rsquo;s tribe), Nehemiah. The next and
seventh sign will be the appearance of Armillus, born of a marble
statue in a church at Rome. The Romans will accept him as their god,
and the whole world be subject to him. Nehemiah alone will refuse to
worship him, and for this will be slain, and the Jews suffer terrible
things. The eighth sign will be the appearance of the angel Michael
with three blasts of his trumpet&mdash;which shall call forth Elias,
the forerunner, and the true Messias (Ben David), and bring on the war
with Armillus who shall perish, and all christians with him. The ten
tribes shall be gathered into Paradise. Messias shall wed the fairest
daughter of their race, and when he dies his sons shall succeed him,
and reign in unbroken line over a beatified Israel.</p>
<p>The mussulman modification of the notion of Antichrist is very
remarkable. They call him <i>Al Dajjail</i>, that is, the impostor.
They say that Mohammed told his follower Tamisri Al-Dari, that at the
end of the world Antichrist would enter Jerusalem seated on an ass; but
that Jesus will then make his second coming to encounter him. The Beast
of the Apocalypse will aid Antichrist, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>but Jesus will be
joined by Imam Mahadi, who has never died; together they will subdue
Antichrist, and thereafter the mussulmans and christians will for ever
be united in one religion. The Jews, however, will regard Antichrist as
their expected Messias. Antichrist will be blind of one eye, and deaf
of one ear. &lsquo;Unbeliever&rsquo; will be written on his forehead.
In that day the sun will rise in the west.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5097src" href="#xd26e5097" name="xd26e5097src">12</a></p>
<p>The christians poorly requited this amicable theory of the
mussulmans by very extensively identifying Mohammed as Antichrist, at
one period. From that period came the English word <i>mawmet</i>
(idol), and <i>mummery</i> (idolatry), both of which, probably, are
derived from the name of the Arabian Prophet. Daniel&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Little Horn&rsquo; betokens, according to Martin Luther,
Mohammed. &lsquo;But what are the Little Horn&rsquo;s Eyes? The Little
Horn&rsquo;s Eyes,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;mean Mohammed&rsquo;s
Alkoran, or Law, wherewith he ruleth. In the which Law there is nought
but sheer human reason (<span lang="de">eitel menschliche
Vernunft</span>).&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;For his Law,&rsquo; he
reiterates, &lsquo;teaches nothing but that which human understanding
and reason may well like.&rsquo; &hellip; Wherefore &lsquo;Christ will
come upon him with fire and brimstone.&rsquo; When he wrote
this&mdash;in his &lsquo;army sermon&rsquo; against the Turks&mdash;in
1529, he had never seen a Koran. &lsquo;Brother Richard&rsquo;s&rsquo;
(Predigerordens) <i lang="la">Confutatio Alcoran</i>, dated 1300,
formed the exclusive basis of his argument. But in Lent of 1540, he
relates, a Latin translation, though a very unsatisfactory one, fell
into his hands, and once more he returned to Brother Richard, and did
his Refutation into German, supplementing his version with brief but
racy notes. This Brother Richard had, according to his own <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>account, gone in quest of knowledge to
&lsquo;Babylon, that beautiful city of the Saracens,&rsquo; and at
Babylon he had learnt Arabic and been inured in the evil ways of the
Saracens. When he had safely returned to his native land he set about
combating the same. And this is his exordium:&mdash;&lsquo;At the time
of the Emperor Heraclius there arose a man, yea, a Devil, and a
first-born child of Satan, &hellip; who wallowed in &hellip; and he was
dealing in the Black Art, and his name it was Machumet.&rsquo; &hellip;
This work Luther made known to his countrymen by translating and
commenting, prefacing, and rounding it off by an epilogue. True, his
notes amount to little more but an occasional &lsquo;Oh fie, for shame,
you horrid Devil, you damned Mahomet,&rsquo; or &lsquo;O Satan, Satan,
you shall pay for that,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, Devils,
Saracens, Turks, it&rsquo;s all the same,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Here the
Devil smells a rat,&rsquo; or briefly, &lsquo;O Pfui Dich,
Teufel!&rsquo; except when he modestly, with a query, suggests whether
those Assassins, who, according to his text, are regularly educated to
go out into the world in order to kill and slay all Worldly Powers, may
not, perchance, be the Gypsies or the &lsquo;Tattern&rsquo; (Tartars);
or when he breaks down with a &lsquo;<span lang="la">Hic nescio quid
dicat translator</span>.&rsquo; His epilogue, however, is devoted to a
special disquisition as to whether Mohammed or the Pope be worse. And
in the twenty-second chapter of this disquisition he has arrived at the
final conclusion that, after all, the Pope is worse, and that he, and
not Mohammed, is the real &lsquo;Endechrist.&rsquo;
&lsquo;<i>Wohlen</i>,&rsquo; he winds up, &lsquo;God grant us his
grace, and punish both the Pope and Mohammed, together with their
devils. I have done my part as a true prophet and teacher. Those who
won&rsquo;t listen may leave it alone.&rsquo; In similar strains speaks
the learned and gentle Melancthon. In an introductory epistle to a
reprint of that same Latin Koran which displeased Luther so much,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>he finds fault with Mohammed, or rather, to use
his own words, he thinks that &lsquo;Mohammed is inspired by
Satan,&rsquo; because he &lsquo;does not explain what sin is,&rsquo;
and further, since he &lsquo;showeth not the reason of human
misery.&rsquo; He agrees with Luther about the Little Horn: though in
another treatise he is rather inclined to see in Mohammed both Gog and
Magog. And &lsquo;Mohammed&rsquo;s sect,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is
altogether made up (<i lang="la">conflata</i>) of blasphemy, robbery,
and shameful lusts.&rsquo; Nor does it matter in the least what the
Koran is all about. &lsquo;Even if there were anything less scurrilous
in the book, it need not concern us any more than the portents of the
Egyptians, who invoked snakes and cats&#8202;&hellip;. Were it not that
partly this Mohammedan pest, and partly the Pope&rsquo;s idolatry, have
long been leading us straight to wreck and ruin&mdash;may God have
mercy upon <i>some</i> of us!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>&lsquo;Mawmet&rsquo; was used by Wicliffe for idol in his
translation of the New Testament, <a class="biblink xd26e43" title=

Acts vii. 41</a>, &lsquo;And they made a calf in those days and offered
a sacrifice to the Mawmet&rsquo; (idol). The word, though otherwise
derived by some, is probably a corruption of Mohammed. In the
&lsquo;Mappa Mundi&rsquo; of the thirteenth century we find the
representation of the golden calf in the promontory of Sinai, with the
superscription &lsquo;Mahum&rsquo; for Mohammed, whose name under
various corruptions, such as Mahound, Mawmet, &amp;c., became a general
byword in the medi&aelig;val languages for an idol. In a missionary

<p>In these days, when the very mention of the Devil raises a smile, we
can hardly realise the solemnity with which his work was once viewed.
When Goethe represents Mephistopheles as undertaking to teach
Faust&rsquo;s class in theology and dwells on his orthodoxy, it is the
refrain of the faith of many generations. The Devil was not
&lsquo;God&rsquo;s Ape,&rsquo; as Tertullian called him, in any comical
way; not only was his ceremonial believed to be modelled on that of
God, but his inspiration of his followers was believed to be quite as
potent and earnest. Tertullian was constrained to write in this
strain&mdash;&lsquo;Blush, my Roman fellow-soldiers, even if ye are not
to be judged by Christ, but by any soldier of Mithras, who when he is
undergoing initiation in the cave, the very camp of the Powers of
Darkness, when the wreath is offered him (a sword being placed between
as if in semblance of martyrdom), and then about to be set on his head,
he is warned to put forth his hand and push the wreath away,
transferring it to, perchance, his shoulder, saying at the same time,
My only crown is Mithras. And thenceforth he never wears a wreath; and
this is a mark he has for a test, whenever tried as to his initiation,
for he is immediately proved to be a soldier of Mithras if he throws
down the wreath offered him, saying his crown is in his god. Let us
therefore acknowledge the craft of the Devil, who mimics certain things
of those that be divine, in order that he may confound and judge us by
the faith of his own followers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was written before the exaltation of Christianity under
Constantine. When the age of the martyrdom of the so-called pagans came
on, these formul&aelig; became real, and the christians were still more
confounded by finding that the worshippers of the Devil, as they
thought them, could yield up their lives in many parts of Europe as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>bravely for their faith as any christian had
ever done. The &lsquo;Prince of this world&rsquo; became thus an
unmeaning phrase except for the heretics. Christ had become the Prince
of this world; and he was opposed by religious devotees as earnest as
any who had suffered under Nero. The relation of the Opposition to the
Devil was yet more closely defined when it claimed the christian name
for its schism or heresy, and when it carried its loyalty to the
Adversary of the Church to the extent of suffering martyrdom.
&lsquo;Tell me, holy father,&rsquo; said Evervinus to St. Bernard,
concerning the Albigenses, &lsquo;how is this? They entered to the
stake and bore the torment of the fire not only with patience, but with
joy and gladness. I wish your explanation, how these members of the
Devil could persist in their heresy with a courage and constancy
scarcely to be found in the most religious of the faith of
Christ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the personification of Antichrist had a
natural but still wonderful development. He was to be born of a virgin,
in Babylon, to be educated at Bethsaida and Chorazin, and to make a
triumphal entry into Jerusalem, proclaiming himself the Son of God. In
the interview at Messina (1202) between Richard I. and the Abbot
Joachim of Floris, the king said, &lsquo;I thought that Antichrist
would be born at Antioch or in Babylon, and of the tribe of Dan, and
would reign in the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, and would walk in
that land in which Christ walked, and would reign in it for three years
and a half, and would dispute against Elijah and Enoch, and would kill
them, and would afterwards die; and that after his death God would give
sixty days of repentance, in which those might repent which should have
erred from the way of truth, and have been seduced by the preaching of
Antichrist and his false prophets.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<p>This belief was reflected in Western Europe in the belief that the
congregation of Witches assembled on their Sabbath (an institution then
included among paganisms) to celebrate grand mass to the Devil, and
that all the primitive temples were raised in honour of Satan. In the
Russian Church the correspondence between the good and evil powers,
following their primitive faith in the conflict between Byelbog and
Tchernibog (white god and black god), went to the curious extent of
picturing in hell a sort of infernal Trinity. The Father throned in
Heaven with the Son between his knees and the Dove beside or beneath
him, was replied to by a majestic Satan in hell, holding his Son
(Judas) on his knees, and the Serpent acting as counteragent of the
Dove. This singular arrangement may still be seen in many of the
pictures which cover the walls of the oldest Russian churches (<a href=
"#fig09">Fig. 9</a>). The infernal god is not without a solemn majesty
answering to that of his great antagonist above. The Serpent of Sins
proceeds from the diabolical Father and Son, passing from beneath their
throne through one of the two mouths of Hell, and then winds upward,
hungrily opening its jaws near the terrible Balances where souls are
weighed (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>). Along its hideous length are
seated at regular intervals nine winged devils, representing probably
antagonists of the nine Sephiroth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254"
href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>or &AElig;ons of the Gnostic
theology. Each is armed with a hook whereby the souls weighed and found
wanting may be dragged. The sins which these devils represent are
labelled, generally on rings around the serpent, and increase in
heinousness towards the head. It is a curious fact that the Sin nearest
the head is marked &lsquo;Unmercifulness.&rsquo; Strange and
unconscious sarcasm on an Omnipotent Deity under whose sway exists this

</div>
<p>Truly said the Epistle of John, there be many Antichrists. If this
was true before the word Christianity had been formed, or the system it
names, what was the case afterwards? For centuries we find vast systems
denouncing each other as Antichrist. And ultimately, as a subtle
hardly-conscious heresy spread abroad, the great excommunicator of
antichrists itself, Rome, acquired that title, which it has never
shaken off since. The See of Rome did not first receive that
appellation from Protestants, but from its own chiefs. Gregory himself
(<span class="sc">A.C.</span> 590) started the idea by declaring that
any man who held even the shadow of such power as the Popes arrogated
to themselves after his time would be the forerunner of Antichrist.
Arnulphus, Bishop of Orleans, in an invective against John XV. at
Rheims (<span class="sc">A.C.</span> 991), intimated that a Pope
destitute of charity was Antichrist. But the stigma was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>at
length fixed (twelfth century) by Amalrich of Bena (&lsquo;<span lang=
"la">Quia Papa esset Antichristus et Roma Babylon et ipse sedit in
Monte Oliveti, <i>i.e.</i>, in pinguedine potestatis</span>&rsquo;);
and also by the Abbot Joachim (<span class="sc">A.C.</span> 1202). The
theory of Richard I., as stated to Joachim concerning Antichrist, has
already been quoted. It was in the presence of the Archbishops of Rouen
and Auxerre, and the Bishop of Bayonne, and represented their opinion
and the common belief of the time. But Joachim said the Second
Apocalyptic Beast represented some great prelate who will be like Simon
Magus, and, as it were, universal Pontiff, and that very Antichrist of
whom St. Paul speaks. Hildebrand was the first Pope to whom this ugly
label was affixed, but the career of Alexander VI. (Roderic Borgia)
made it for ever irremovable for the Protestant mind. There is in the
British Museum a volume of caricatures, dated 1545, in which occurs an
ingenious representation of Alexander VI. The Pope is first seen in his
ceremonial robes; but a leaf being raised, another figure is joined to
the lower part of the former, and there appears the papal devil, the
cross in his hand being changed to a pitchfork (<a href="#fig11">Fig.
11</a>). Attached to it is an explanation in German giving the legend
of the Pope&rsquo;s death. He was poisoned (1503) by the cup he had
prepared for another man. It was afterwards said that he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>had
secured the papacy by aid of the Devil. Having asked how long he would
reign, the Devil returned an equivocal answer; and though Alexander
understood that it was to be fifteen years, it proved to be only
eleven. When in 1520 Pope Leo X. issued his formal bull against Luther,
the reformer termed it &lsquo;the execrable bull of Antichrist.&rsquo;
An Italian poem of the time having represented Luther as the offspring
of Meg&aelig;ra, the Germans returned the invective in a form more
likely to impress the popular mind; namely, in a caricature (<a href=
"#fig12">Fig. 12</a>), representing the said Fury as nursing the Pope.
This caricature is also of date 1545, and with it were others showing
Alecto and Tisiphone acting in other capacities for the papal babe.</p>

<p>The Lutherans had made the discovery that the number of the
Apocalyptic Beast, 666, put into Hebrew numeral letters, contained the
words <i>Aberin Kadescha Papa</i> (our holy father the Pope). The
downfall of this Antichrist was a favourite theme of pulpit eloquence,
and also with artists. A very spirited pamphlet was printed (1521), and
illustrated with designs by Luther&rsquo;s friend Lucas Cranach. It was
entitled <i lang="de">Passional Christi und Antichristi</i>. The fall
of the papal Antichrist (<a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a>), has for its
companion one of Christ washing the feet of his disciples.</p>
<p>But the Catholics could also make discoveries; and among many other
things they found that the word &lsquo;Luther&rsquo; in Hebrew numerals
also made the number of the Beast. It was remembered that one of the
earliest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>predictions concerning Antichrist was that he
would travesty the birth of Christ from a virgin by being born of a nun
by a Bishop. Luther&rsquo;s marriage with the nun Catharine von Bora
came sufficiently near the prediction to be welcomed by his enemies.
The source of his inspiration as understood by Catholics is cleverly
indicated in a caricature of the period (<a href="#fig14">Fig.
14</a>).</p>

<p>The theory that the Papacy represents Antichrist has so long been
the solemn belief of rebels against its authority, that it has become a
vulgarised article of Protestant faith. On the other hand, Catholics
appear to take a political and prospective view of Antichrist. Cardinal
Manning, in his pastoral following the election of Leo XIII., said:
&lsquo;A tide of revolution has swept over all countries. Every people
in Europe is inwardly divided <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258"
href="#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>against itself, and the old
society of Christendom, with its laws, its sanctities, and its
stability, is giving way before the popular will, which has no law, or
rather which claims to be a law to itself. This is at least the
forerunning sign of the Lawless One, who in his own time shall be
revealed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Throughout the endless exchange of epithets, it has been made clear
that Antichrist is the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the notion of a
personal Devil. From the day when the word was first coined, it has
assumed every variety of shape, has fitted with equal precision the
most contrarious things and persons; and the need of such a novel form
at one point or another in the progress of controversy is a satire on
the inadequacy of Satan and his ancient ministers. Bygone Devils cannot
represent new animosities. The ascent of every ecclesiastical or
theological system is traceable in massacres and martyrdoms;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>each of these, whether on one side or the other,
helps to develop a new devil. The story of Antichrist shows devils in
the making. Meantime, to eyes that see how every system so built up
must sacrifice a virtue at every stage of its ascent, it will be
sufficiently clear that every powerful Church is Adversary of the
religion it claims to represent. Buddhism is Antibuddha; Islam is
Antimohammed; Christianity is Antichrist. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

&lsquo;But,&rsquo; says Professor King (Gnostics, p. 52), &lsquo;a
dispassionate examiner will discover that these two zealous Fathers
somewhat beg the question in assuming that the Mithraic rites were
invented as counterfeits of the Christian Sacraments; the former having
really been in existence long before the promulgation of
Christianity.&rsquo; Whatever may have been the incidents in the life
of Christ connected with such things, it is certainly true, as
Professor King says, that these &lsquo;were afterwards invested with
the mystic and supernatural virtues, in a later age insisted upon as
articles of faith, by succeeding and unscrupulous missionaries, eager
to outbid the attractions of more ancient ceremonies of a cognate
character.&rsquo; In the porch of the Church <i lang="it">Bocca della
Verita</i> at Rome, there is, or was, a fresco of Ceres shelling corn
and Bacchus pressing grapes, from them falling the elements of the
Eucharist to a table below. This was described to me by a friend, but
when I went to see it in 1872, it had just been whitewashed over! I
called the attention of Signor Rosa to this shameful proceeding, and he
had then some hope that this very interesting relic might be
recovered.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e5065src">&uarr;</a></p>

expression of pride and satisfaction as he looks forth on the gay city

curiously blended with a look of envy and lust. His elegant head-dress

<p>His seat on the fine parapet is in contrast with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>place assigned him in Eastern
traditions&mdash;ruins and desert places,&mdash;but otherwise he fairly
fulfilled, no doubt, early ideas in selecting his headquarters at
Paris. A mussulman legend says that when, after the Fall of Man, Allah
was mitigating the sentences he had pronounced, Iblis (who, as the
Koran relates, pleaded and obtained the deferment of his consignment to
Hell until the resurrection, and unlimited power over sinners who do
not accept the word of Allah) asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where shall I dwell in the meantime?</p>
<p>&lsquo;In ruins, tombs, and all other unclean places shunned by
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall be my food?</p>
<p>&lsquo;All things slain in the name of idols.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How shall I quench my thirst?</p>
<p>&lsquo;With wine and intoxicating liquors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall occupy my leisure hours?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Music, song, love-poetry, and dancing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is my watchword?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The curse of Allah until the day of judgment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how shall I contend with man, to whom thou hast granted
two guardian angels, and who has received thy revelation?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thy progeny shall be more numerous than his,&mdash;for for
every man that is born, there shall come into the world seven evil
spirits&mdash;but they shall be powerless against the
faithful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Iblis with wine, song, and dance&mdash;the &lsquo;pride of
life&rsquo;&mdash;is also said to have been aided in entering Paradise
by the peacock, which he flattered.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5348src"
href="#xd26e5348" name="xd26e5348src">1</a></p>
<p>This fable, though later than the era of Mohammed in form, is as
ancient as the myth of Eden in substance. The germ of it is already in
the belief that Jehovah <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>separated from the rest of the
earth a garden, and from the human world a family of his own, and from
the week a day of his own. The reply of the elect to the proud Gentile
aristocracy was an ascetic caste established by covenant with the King
of kings. This attitude of the pious caste turned the barbaric
aristocrats, in a sense, to democrats. Indeed Sama&euml;l, in whom the
execrated Dukes of Edom were ideally represented, might be almost
described as the Democratic Devil. According to an early Jewish legend,
Jehovah, having resolved to separate &lsquo;men&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>,
Jews) from &lsquo;swine&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>, idolaters, Gentiles), made
circumcision the seal on them as children of Abraham. There having
been, however, Jews who were necessarily never circumcised, their
souls, it was arranged, should pass at death into the forms of certain
sacred birds where they would be purified, and finally united to the
elect in Paradise. Now, Sama&euml;l, or Adam Belial as he was sometimes
called, is said to have appealed to the Creator that this arrangement
should include all races of beings. &lsquo;Lord of the world!&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;we also are of your creation. Thou art our father. As thou
savest the souls of Israel by transforming them that they may be
brought back again and made immortal, so also do unto us! Why shouldst
thou regard the seed of Abraham before us?&rsquo; Jehovah answered,
&lsquo;Have you done the same that Abraham did, who recognised me from
his childhood and went into Chaldean fire for love of me? You have seen
that I rescued him from your hands, and from the fiery oven which had
no power over him, and yet you have not loved and worshipped me.
Henceforth speak no more of good or evil.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5361src" href="#xd26e5361" name="xd26e5361src">2</a></p>
<p>The old rabbinical books which record this conversation do not
report Sama&euml;l&rsquo;s answer; nor is it necessary: that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>answer was given by Jesus and Paul breaking down
the partitions between Jew and Gentile. It was quite another thing,
however, to include the world morally. Jesus, it would seem, aimed at
this also; he came &lsquo;eating and drinking,&rsquo; and the orthodox
said Sama&euml;l was in him. Personally, he declined to substitute even
the cosmopolitan rite of baptism for the discredited national rite of
circumcision. But Paul was of another mind. His pharisaism was
spiritualised and intensified in his new faith, to which the great
world was all an Adversary.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous concession, this giving up of the gay and
beautiful world, with its mirth and amusements, its fine arts and
romance&mdash;to the Devil. Unswerving Nemesis has followed that wild
theorem in many forms, of which the most significant is Asmodeus.</p>
<p>Asmod&auml;us, or A&ecirc;shma-da&ecirc;va of the Zend texts, the
modern Persian Khasm, is etymologically what Carlyle might call
&lsquo;the god Wish;&rsquo; <i>a&ecirc;sha</i> meaning
&lsquo;wish,&rsquo; from the Sanskrit root <i>ish</i>, &lsquo;to
desire.&rsquo; An almost standing epithet of A&ecirc;shma is
Khrv&icirc;dra, meaning apparently &lsquo;having a hurtful weapon or
lance.&rsquo; He is occasionally mentioned immediately after
Anr&ocirc;-mainyus (Ahriman); sometimes is expressly named as one of
his most prominent supporters. In the remarkable combat between
Ahuro-mazda (Ormuzd) and <span class="corr" id="xd26e5379" title=
"Source: Anr&ocirc;mainyus">Anr&ocirc;-mainyus</span>, described in
Zam. Y. 46, the good deity summons to his aid Vohumano, Ashavahista,
and Fire; while the Evil One is aided by Ak&ocirc;mano, A&ecirc;shma,
and Aji-Dah&aacute;ka.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5382src" href=
"#xd26e5382" name="xd26e5382src">3</a> Here, therefore, A&ecirc;shma
appears as opposed to Ashavahista, &lsquo;supreme purity&rsquo; of the
Lord of Fire. A&ecirc;shma is the spirit of the lower or impure Fire,
Lust and Wrath. A Sanskrit text styles him Kossa-deva, &lsquo;the god
of Wrath.&rsquo; In Ya&ccedil;na 27, 35, &#346;raosha,
A&ecirc;shma&rsquo;s opponent, is invoked to shield the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>faithful &lsquo;in both worlds from Death the
Violent, from A&ecirc;shma the Violent, from the hosts of Violence that
raise aloft the terrible banner&mdash;from the assaults of A&ecirc;shma
that he makes along with V&iacute;d&aacute;tu (&lsquo;Divider,
Destroyer&rsquo;), the demon-created.&rsquo; He is thus the leading
representative of dissolution, the fatal power of Ahriman. Ormuzd is
said to have created &#346;raosha to be the destroyer of
&lsquo;A&ecirc;shma of the fatal lance.&rsquo; &#346;raosha (&lsquo;the
Hearer&rsquo;) is the moral vanquisher of A&ecirc;shma, in distinction
from Haoma, who is his chief opponent in the physical domain.</p>
<p>Such, following Windischmann,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5395src"
href="#xd26e5395" name="xd26e5395src">4</a> is the origin of the devil
whom the apocryphal book of Tobit has made familiar in Europe as
Asmodeus. Aschmedai, as the Jews called him, appears in this story as
precisely that spirit described in the Avesta&mdash;the devil of
Violence and Lust, whose passion for Sara leads him to slay her seven
husbands on their wedding-night. The devils of Lust are considered
elsewhere, and Asmodeus among them; there is another aspect of him
which here concerns us. He is a fastidious devil. He will not have the
object of his passion liable to the embrace of any other. He cannot
endure bad smells, and that raised by the smoke of the fish-entrails
burnt by Tobit drives him &lsquo;into the utmost parts of Egypt, where
the angel bound him.&rsquo; It is, however, of more importance to read
the story by the light of the general reputation of Aschmedai among the
Jews and Arabians. It was notably that of the devil represented in the
Moslem tradition at the beginning of this chapter. He is the Eastern
Don Giovanni and Lothario; he plies Noah and Solomon with wine, and
seduces their wives, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href=
"#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>always aims high with his dashing
intrigues. He would have cried Amen to Luther&rsquo;s lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Who loves not wine, woman, and song,</p>
<p class="line">He lives a fool his whole life long.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Besides being an aristocrat, he is a scholar, the most
learned Master of Arts, educated in the great College of Hell, founded
by Asa and Asael, as elsewhere related. He was fond of gaming; and so
fashionable that Calmet believed his very name signifies fine
dress.</p>
<p>Now, the moral reflections in the Book of Tobit, and its casual
intimations concerning the position of the persons concerned, show that
they were Jewish captives of the humblest working class, whose religion
is of a type now found chiefly among the more ignorant sectarians.
Tobit&rsquo;s moral instructions to his son, &lsquo;In pride is
destruction and much trouble, and in lewdness is decay and much
want,&rsquo; &lsquo;Drink not wine to make thee drunken,&rsquo; and his
careful instructions about finding wealth in the fear of God, are
precisely such as would shape a devil in the image of Asmodeus.
Tobit&rsquo;s moral truisms are made falsities by his puritanism:
&lsquo;Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness;&rsquo;
&lsquo;but give nothing to the wicked;&rsquo; &lsquo;If thou serve God
he will repay thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cakes and ale&rsquo; do not cease to exist because Tobits are
virtuous; but unfortunately they may be raised from their subordinate
to an insubordinate place by the transfer of religious restraints to
the hands of Ignorance and Cant. Asmodeus, defined against Persian and
Jewish asceticism and hypocrisy, had his attractions for men of the
world. Through him the devil became perilously associated with wit,
gallantry, and the one creed of youth which is not at all
consumptive&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Grey is all Theory,</p>
<p class="line">Green Life&rsquo;s golden-fruited tree!</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>Especially did Asmodeus represent the subordination of so-called
&lsquo;religious&rsquo; and tribal distinctions to secular
considerations. As Sama&euml;l had petitioned for an extension of the
Abrahamic Covenant to all the world and failed to secure it from
Jehovah, Asmodeus proposed to disregard the distinction. There is much
in the Book of Tobit which looks as if it were written especially with
the intention of persuading Jewish youth, tempted by Babylonians to
marriage, that their lovers might prove to be succubi or incubi. Tobit
implores his son to marry in his own tribe, and not take a
&lsquo;strange woman.&rsquo; Asmodeus was as cosmopolitan as the god of
Love himself, and many of his uglier early characteristics were hidden
out of sight by such later developments.</p>
<p>Gustave Dor&eacute; has painted in his vivid way the &lsquo;Triumph
of Christianity.&rsquo; In it we see the angelic hosts with drawn
swords overthrowing the forms adored of paganism&mdash;hurling them
headlong into an abyss. So far as the battle and victory go, this is
just the conception which an early christian would have had of what
took place through the advent of Christ. It filled their souls with joy
to behold by Faith&rsquo;s vision those draped angels casting down
undraped goddesses; they would delight to imagine how the fall might
break the bones of those beautiful limbs. For they never thought of
these gods and goddesses as statues, but as real seductive devils; and
when these christians had brought over the arts, they often pictured
the black souls coming out of these fair idols as they fell.</p>
<p>Dor&eacute; may have tried to make the angels as beautiful as the
goddesses, but he has not succeeded. In this he has interpreted the
heart behind every deformity which was ever added to a pagan deity. The
horror of the monks was transparent homage. Why did they starve and
scourge their bodies, and roll them in thorns? Because <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>not
even by defacing the beautiful images were they able to expel from
their inward worship the lovely ideals they represented.</p>
<p>It is not difficult now to perceive that the old monks were
consigning the pagan ideals to imaginary and themselves to actual
hells, in full hope of thereby gaining permanent possession of the same
beauty abjured on earth. The loveliness of the world was transient.
They grew morbid about death; beneath the rosiest form they saw the
skeleton. The heavenly angels they longed for were Venuses and Apollos,
with no skeletons visible beneath their immortalised flesh. They never
made sacrifices for a disembodied heaven. The force of self-crucifixion
lay in the creed&mdash;&lsquo;I believe in the resurrection of the
body, and the life everlasting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The world could not generally be turned into a black procession at
its own funeral. In proportion to the conquests of Christianity must be
its progressive surrender to the unconquerable&mdash;to human nature.
Aphrodite and Eros, over whose deep graves nunneries and monasteries
had been built, were the first to revive, and the story, as Mr. Pater
has told it, is like some romantic version of Ishtar&rsquo;s Descent
into Hades and her resurrection.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5433src"
href="#xd26e5433" name="xd26e5433src">5</a> While as yet the earth
seemed frostbound, long before the Renaissance, the song of the turtle
was heard in the ballad of Aucassin and Nicolette. The christian knight
will marry the beautiful Saracen, and to all priestly warnings that he
will surely go to hell, replies, &lsquo;What could I do in Paradise? I
care only to go where I can be with Nicolette. Who go to Paradise? Old
priests, holy cripples, dried-up monks, who pass their lives before
altars. I much prefer Hell, where go the brave, the gay, and beautiful.
There will be the players on harps, the classic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>poets and singers; and there I shall not be
parted from Nicolette!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Along with pretty Saracen maidens, or memories of them, were brought
back into Europe legends of Asmodeus. Aphrodite and Eros might disguise
themselves in his less known and less anathematised name, so that he
could manage to sing of his love for Sara, of Parsi for Jewess, under
the names of christian Aucassin and saracen Nicolette. In the Eastern
Church he reappeared also. There are beautiful old pictures which show
the smart cavalier, feather-in-cap, on the youth&rsquo;s left, while on
his right stands &lsquo;grey Theory&rsquo; in the form of a
long-bearded friar. Such pictures, no doubt, taught for many a
different lesson from that intended&mdash;namely, that the beat of the
heart is on the left.</p>
<p>Where St. Benedict rolled himself in thorns for dreaming of
<i>his</i> (deserted) &lsquo;Nicolette,&rsquo; St. Francis planted
roses; and the Latin Church had to recognise this evolution of seven
centuries. They hid the thorns in the courts of convents, and sold the
roses to the outside world as indulgences. But as Asmodeus had not
respected the line between Jew and Gentile in Nineveh, so he passed
over that between priest, nun, and worldling in the West. In the days
of Witchcraft the Church was scandalised by the rumour that the nuns of
the Franciscan Convent of Louviers had largely taken to sorcery, and
were attending the terrible &lsquo;Witches&rsquo; Sabbaths.&rsquo; The
nun most prominent in this affair was one Madeleine Bavent. The priests
announced that she had confessed that she was borne away to the orgies
by the demon Asmodeus, and that he had induced her to profane the
sacred host. It turned out that the nuns had engaged in intrigues with
the priests who had charge of them&mdash;especially with Fathers David,
Picard, and Boul&eacute;&mdash;but Asmodeus was credited with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>crime, and the nuns were punished for it.
Madeleine was condemned to life-long penance, and Picard anticipated
the fire by a suicide, in which he was said to have been assisted by
the devil.</p>
<p>Following the rabbinical tradition which represented him as
continually passing from the high infernal College of Asa and Asael to
the earth to apply his arts of sorcery, Asmodeus gained a respectable
position in European literature through the romance of Le Sage
(&lsquo;Le Diable Boiteux&rsquo;), and his fame so gained did much to
bring about in France that friendly feeling for the Devil which has
long been a characteristic of French literature. A very large number of
books, periodicals, and journals in France have gained popularity
through the Devil&rsquo;s name. Asmodeus was, in fact, the
Arch-bohemian. As such, he largely influenced the conception of
Mephistopheles as rendered by Goethe&mdash;himself the Prince of
Bohemians. The old horror of Asmodeus for bad smells is insulted in the
name Mephistopheles, and this devil is many rolled into one; yet in
many respects his kinship to Asmodeus is revealed. All the dried
starveling Anthonys and Benedicts are, in a cultured way, present in
the theologian and scholar Faust; all the sweet ladies that haunted
their seclusion became realistic in Gretchen. She is the Nemesis of
suppressed passions.</p>
<p>One province of nature after another has been recovered from
Asceticism. In this case Ishtar has had to regain her apparel and
ornaments at successive portals that are centuries, and they are not
all recovered yet. But we have gone far enough, even in puritanised
England, to produce a &lsquo;madman&rsquo; far-seeing enough to behold
<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>. The case of Asmodeus is stated
well, albeit radically, by William Blake, in that proverb which was
told him by the devils, whom he alone <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>of midnight
travellers was shrewd enough to consult: &lsquo;The pride of the
peacock is the glory of God; the lust of the goat is the bounty of God;
the wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.&rsquo; When that statement
is improved, as it well may be, it will be when those who represent
religion shall have learned that human like other nature is commanded
by obedience.</p>
<p>In this connection may be mentioned a class of legends indicating
the Devil&rsquo;s sensitiveness with regard to his personal appearance.
The anxiety of the priests and hermits to have him represented as
hideous was said to have been warmly resented by Satan, one of the most
striking being the legend of many versions concerning a Sacristan, who
was also an artist, who ornamented an abbey with a devil so ugly that
none could behold it without terror. It was believed he had by
inspiration secured an exact portrait of the archfiend. The Devil
appeared to the Sacristan, reproached him with having made him so ugly,
and threatened to punish him grievously if he did not make him better
looking. Although this menace was thrice repeated, the Sacristan
refused to comply. The Devil then tempted him into an intrigue with a
lady of the neighbourhood, and they eloped after robbing the abbey of
its treasure. But they were caught, and the Sacristan imprisoned. The
Devil then appears and offers to get him out of his trouble if he will
only destroy the ugly likeness, and make another and handsomer. The
Sacristan consented, and suddenly found himself in bed as if nothing
had happened, while the Devil in his image lay in chains. The Devil
when discovered vanished; the Sacristan got off on the theory that
crimes and all had been satanic juggles. But the Sacristan took care to
substitute a handsome devil for the ugly <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>one. In another
version the Sacristan remained faithful to his original portraiture of
the Devil despite all menaces of the latter, who resolved to take a
dire revenge. While the artist was completing his ornamentation of the
abbey with an image of the Virgin, made as beautiful as the fiend near
it was ugly, the Devil broke the ladder on which he was working, and a
fatal fall was only prevented by the hand of the Madonna he had just
made, which was outstretched to sustain him. The accompanying picture
of this scene (<a href="#fig16">Fig. 16</a>) is from &lsquo;Queen
Mary&rsquo;s Psalter&rsquo; in the British Museum.</p>
<p>Vasari relates that when Spinello of Arezzo, in his famous fresco of
the fall of the rebellious angels, had painted the hideous devil with
seven faces about his body, the fiend appeared to him in the same form,
and asked the artist where he had seen him in so frightful an aspect,
and why he had treated him so ignominiously. When Spinello awoke in
horror, he fell into a state of gloom, and soon after died.</p>

<p>The Persian poet S&aacute;di has a remarkable passage conceived in
the spirit of these legends, but more kindly.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Boehme relates that when Satan was asked the cause of
God&rsquo;s enmity to him and his consequent downfall, he replied,
&lsquo;I wished to be an artist.&rsquo; There is in this quaint
sentence a very true intimation of the allurements which, in ancient
times, the arts of the Gentile possessed for the Jews and christian
judaisers. Indeed, a similar feeling towards the sensuous attractions
of the Catholic and Ritualistic Churches is not uncommon among the
prosaic and puritanical sects whose younger members are often thus
charmed away from them. Dr. Donne preached a sermon before Oliver
Cromwell at Whitehall, in which he affirmed that the Muses were damned
spirits of devils; and the discussion on the Drama which occurred at
Sheffield Church Congress (1878), following Dr. Bickerstith&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>opening discourse on &lsquo;the Devil and his
wiles,&rsquo; shows that the Low Church wing cherishes much the same
opinion as that of Dr. Donne. The dread of the theatre among some sects
amounts to terror. The writer remembers the horror that spread through
a large Wesleyan circle, with which he was connected, when a
distinguished minister of that body, just returned from Europe,
casually remarked that &lsquo;the theatre at Rome seemed to be poorly
supported.&rsquo; The fearful confession spread through the
denomination, and it was understood that the observant traveller had
&lsquo;made shipwreck of faith.&rsquo; The Methodist instinct told
true: the preacher became an accomplished Gentile.</p>
<p>Music made its way but slowly in the Church, and the suspicion of it
still lingers among many sects. The Quakers took up the burthen of
Epiphanius who wrote against the flute-players, &lsquo;After the
pattern of the serpent&rsquo;s form has the flute been invented for the
deceiving of mankind. Observe the figure that the player makes in
blowing his flute. Does he not bend himself up and down to the right
hand and to the left, like unto the serpent? These forms hath the Devil
used to manifest his blasphemy against things heavenly, to destroy
things upon earth, to encompass the world, capturing right and left
such as lend an ear to his seductions.&rsquo; The unregenerate birds
that carol all day, be it Sabbath or Fast, have taught the composer
that his best inspiration is from the Prince of the Air. Tartini wrote
over a hundred sonatas and as many <span class="corr" id="xd26e5541"
title="Source: cencertos">concertos</span>, but he rightly valued above
them all his &lsquo;<span lang="it">Sonata del Diavolo</span>.&rsquo;
Concerning this he wrote to the astronomer Lalande:&mdash;&lsquo;One
night, in the year 1713, I dreamed that I had made a compact with his
Satanic Majesty, by which he was received into my service. Everything
succeeded to the utmost of my desires, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>my
every wish was anticipated by my new domestic. I thought that, in
taking up my violin to practise, I jocosely asked him if he could play
on this instrument. He answered that he believed he was able to pick
out a tune; when, to my astonishment, he began a sonata, so strange,
and yet so beautiful, and executed in so masterly a manner, that in the
whole course of my life I had never heard anything so exquisite. So
great was my amazement that I could scarcely breathe. Awakened by the
violence of my feelings, I instantly seized my violin, in the hope of
being able to catch some part of the ravishing melody which I had just
heard, but all in vain. The piece which I composed according to my
scattered recollections is, it is true, the best I ever produced. I
have entitled it, &lsquo;<span lang="it">Sonata del
Diavolo</span>;&rsquo; but it is so far inferior to that which had made
so forcible an impression on me, that I should have dashed my violin
into a thousand pieces, and given up music for ever in despair, had it
been possible to deprive myself of the enjoyments which I receive from
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fire and originality of Tartini&rsquo;s great work is a fine
example of that power which Timoleon called <i>Automatia</i>, and
Goethe the <i lang="de">D&auml;monische</i>,&mdash;&lsquo;that which
cannot be explained by reason or understanding; it is not in my nature,
but I am subject to it.&rsquo; &lsquo;It seems to play at will with all
the elements of our being.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Puritans brought upon England and America that relapse into the
ancient asceticism which was shown in the burning of great pictures by
Cromwell&rsquo;s Parliament. It is shown still in the jealousy with
which the puritanised mind in both countries views all that aims at the
simple decoration of life, and whose ministry is to the sense of
beauty. On that day of the week when England and New England hebraise,
as Matthew Arnold says, it is observable that the sabbatarian fury is
especially directed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275"
name="pb275">275</a>]</span>against everything which proposes to give
simple pleasure or satisfy the popular craving for beauty.
Sabbatarianism sees a great deal of hard work going on, but is not much
troubled so long as it is ugly and dismal work. It utters no cry at the
thousands of hands employed on Sunday railways, but is beside itself if
one of the trains takes excursionists to the seaside, and is frantic at
the thought of a comparatively few persons being employed on that day
in Museums and Art Galleries. It is a survival of the old feeling that
the Devil lurks about all beauty and pleasure.</p>
<p>A money-making age has measurably dispersed the superstitions which
once connected the Devil with all great fortunes. For a long time, and
in many regions of the world, the Jews suffered grievously by being
supposed to get their wealth by the Devil&rsquo;s help. Their wealth
(largely the result of their not exchanging it for worldly enjoyments)
so often proved their misfortune, that it was easy to illustrate by
their case the monkish theory that devil&rsquo;s gifts turn to ashes.
Princes were indefatigable in relieving the Jews of such ashes,
however. The Lords of Triar, who possessed the mines of Glucksbrunn,
were believed to have been guided to them by a gold stag which often
appeared to them&mdash;of course the Devil. It is related that when St.
Wolfram went to convert the Frislanders, their king, Radbot, was
prevented from submitting to baptism by a diabolical deception. The
Devil appeared to him as an angel clothed in a garment woven of gold,
on his head a jewelled diadem, and said, &lsquo;Bravest of men! what
has led thee to depart from the Prince of thy gods? Do it not; be
steadfast to thy religion and thou shalt dwell in a house of gold which
I will give into thy possession to all eternity. Go to Wolfram
to-morrow, ask him about those bright dwellings he promises thee. If he
cannot show them, let both parties <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276"
href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>choose an ambassador; I will
be their leader and will show them the gold house I promise
thee.&rsquo; St. Wolfram being unable to show Radbot the bright
dwellings of Paradise, one of his deacons was sent along with a
representative of the king, and the Devil (disguised as a traveller)
took them to the house of gold, which was of incredible size and
splendour. The Deacon exclaimed, &lsquo;If this house be made by God it
will stand for ever; if by the Devil, it must vanish speedily.&rsquo;
Whereupon he crossed himself; the house vanished, and the Deacon found
himself with the Frislander in a swamp. It took them three days to
extricate themselves and return to King Radbot, whom they found
dead.</p>
<p>The ascetic principle which branded the arts, interests, pursuits,
and pleasures of the world as belonging to the domain of Satan,
involved the fatal extreme of including among the outlawed realms all
secular learning. The scholar and man of science were also declared to
be inspired by the &lsquo;pride of life.&rsquo; But this part of our
subject requires a separate chapter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Lucas van Leyden&rsquo;s picture of Satan tempting
Christ (<a href="#fig06">Fig. 6</a>), the fiend is represented in the
garb of a University man of the time. From his head falls a streamer
which coils on the ground to a serpent. From that serpent to the
sceptical scholar demanding a miracle the evolution is fully traceable.
The Serpent, of old the &lsquo;seer,&rsquo; was in its Semitic
adaptation a tempter to forbidden knowledge. This was the earliest
priestly outcry against &lsquo;godless education.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During the Shakespere tercentenary festival at Stratford-on-Avon,
the Bishop of St. Andrews declared that there is not a word in the
Bible warranting homage to Intellect, and such a boast beside the grave
of the most intellectual of Englishmen is in itself a survival
illustrating the tremendous curse hurled by jealous Jehovah on
man&rsquo;s first effort to obtain knowledge. That same Serpent of
knowledge has passed very far, and his curse has many times been
repeated. In the Accadian poem of the fatal Seven, as we have seen, it
is said, &lsquo;In watching was their office;&rsquo; and the Assyrian
version says, &lsquo;Unto heaven that which was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>not
seen they raised.&rsquo; On the Babylonian cylinders is inscribed the
curse of the god of Intelligence (Hea) upon man&mdash;&lsquo;Wisdom and
knowledge hostilely may they injure him.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5589src" href="#xd26e5589" name="xd26e5589src">1</a> The same
Serpent twined round the staff of &AElig;sculapius and whispered those
secrets which made the gods jealous, so that Jove killed the learned
Physician with a flash of lightning. Its teeth were sown when Cadmus
imported the alphabet into Greece; and when these alphabetical
dragon&rsquo;s-teeth had turned to type, the ancient curse was renewed
in legends which connected Fust with the Devil.</p>
<p>The Hebrews are least among races responsible for the legend which
has drifted into Genesis. Nor was the Bishop&rsquo;s boast about their
Bible correct. The homage paid to Solomon was hardly on account of his
moral character. &lsquo;He spake of trees, from the cedar-tree that is
in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he
spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
fishes.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5594src" href="#xd26e5594"
name="xd26e5594src">2</a> While the curse on man for eating the fruit
of knowledge is never quoted in the Hebrew scriptures, there are many
indications of their devotion to knowledge; and their prophets even
heard Jehovah saying, &lsquo;My people are destroyed through lack of
knowledge.&rsquo; It is not wonderful, therefore, that we find among
the Jews the gradual growth of a legend concerning Seth, which may be
regarded as a reply to the curse on the Serpent.</p>
<p>The apotheosis of Seth in rabbinical and mussulman mythology
represents a sort of Semitic Renaissance. As we have seen in a former
chapter, the Egyptians and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href=
"#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>Greeks identified Set with Typhon,
but at the same time that demon was associated with science. He is
astronomically located in Capricorn, the sphere of the hierophants in
the Egyptian Mysteries, and the mansion of the guardians of science.
Thus he would correspond with the Serpent, who, as adapted by the
Hebrews in the myth of Eden, whispers to Eve of divine knowledge. But,
as detached from Typho, Seth, while leaving behind the malignancy,
carried away the reputation for learning usually ascribed to devils.
Thus, while we have had to record so many instances of degraded
deities, we may note in Seth a converted devil. In the mussulman and
rabbinical traditions Seth is a voluminous author; he receives a
library from heaven; he is the originator of astronomy and of many
arts; and, as an instructor in cultivation, he restores many an acre
which as Set he had blighted. In the apocryphal Genesis he is
represented as having been caught up to heaven and shown the future
destiny of mankind. Anastasius of Sinai says that when God created Adam
after his own image, he breathed into him grace and illumination, and a
ray of the Holy Spirit. But when he had sinned this glory left him.
Then he became the father of Cain and Abel. But afterwards it is said
Adam &lsquo;begat a son in his own likeness, after his image, and
called his name &lsquo;Seth,&rsquo; which is not said of Cain and Abel;
and this means that Seth was begotten in the likeness of unfallen man
in paradise&mdash;Seth meaning &lsquo;Resurrection.&rsquo; And all
those then living, when they saw how the face of Seth shone with divine
light, and heard him speak with divine wisdom, said, He is God;
therefore his sons were commonly called the sons of God.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5601src" href="#xd26e5601" name="xd26e5601src">3</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span></p>
<p>That this &lsquo;Resurrection&rsquo; of departed glory and wisdom
was really, as I have said, a Renaissance&mdash;a restoration of
learning from the curse put upon it in the story of the
Serpent&mdash;is indicated by its evolution in the Gnostic myth wherein
Seth was made to avenge Satan. He took under his special care the Tree
of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and planted it in his father&rsquo;s
grave (<a href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a>). Rabbins carried their homage to
Seth even to the extent of vindicating Saturn, the most notorious of
planets, and say that Abraham and the Prophets were inspired by
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5618src" href="#xd26e5618" name=
"xd26e5618src">4</a> The Dog (Jackal) was, in Egyptian symbols, emblem
of the Scribe; Sirius was the Dog-star domiciled with Saturn; Seth was
by them identified with Sirius, as the god of occult and infernal
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5621" title=
"Source: knowlege">knowledge</span>. He was near relative of the
serpent Sesha, familiar of &AElig;sculapius, and so easily connected
with the subtlest of the beasts in Eden which had crept in from the
Iranian mythology.</p>
<p>This reaction was instituted by scholars, who, in their necessarily
timid way of fable, may be said to have recovered the Tree of Knowledge
under guise of homage to Seth. It flourished, as we have seen (chap.
xi.), to the extent of finally raising the Serpent to be a god, and
lowering Jehovah who cursed him to a jealous devil!</p>
<p>But the terror with which Jehovah is said to have been inspired when
he said, &lsquo;The man has become as one of us, to know good and
evil,&rsquo; never failed to reappear among priesthoods when anything
threatened to remove the means of learning from under their control.
The causes of this are too many to be fully considered here; but the
main cause unquestionably was the tendency of learning to release men
from the sway of the priest. The primitive man of science would
speedily discover how many things existed of which his priest was
ignorant, and thus the germ <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href=
"#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>of Scepticism would be planted.
The man who possessed the Sacred Books, in whole or in part, might
become master of the &lsquo;spells&rsquo; supposed to be contained in
its words and sentences, and might use them against the priests; or, at
any rate, he might feel independent of the ordinary apparatus of
salvation.</p>
<p>The anxiety of priests to keep fast hold of the keys of learning, so
that no secular son of Adam should become &lsquo;as one of them,&rsquo;
coupled with the wonderful powers they professed ability to exercise,
powerfully stimulated the curiosity of intellectual men, and led them
to seek after this forbidden fruit in subtle ways, which easily
illustrated the story of the Serpent. The poet Shelley, who was
suspected at Oxford because of his fondness for chemistry, recognised
his mythological ancestry, and used to speak of &lsquo;my cousin, the
Serpent.&rsquo; The joke was born of circumstances sufficiently
scandalous in the last generation to make the Oxonian of to-day blush;
but the like histories of earlier ages are so tragical that, when fully
known by the common people, they will change certain familiar badges
into brands of shame. While the cant goes on about the Church being the
protector of learning through the dark ages, the fact is that, from the
burning of valuable books at Ephesus by christian fanatics (Acts xix.
19) to the present day, the Church has destroyed tenfold more important
works than it ever produced, and almost suffocated the intellectual
life of a thousand years. Amid the unbroken persecution of the Jews by
christian cruelty, which lasted from the early eleventh century for
five hundred years, untold numbers of manuscripts were destroyed, which
might have now been giving the world full and clear knowledge
concerning ages, for whose records arch&aelig;ological scholars are
painfully exploring the crumbled ruins of the East. Synagogues were
believed to be temples of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href=
"#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>Satan; they were plundered and
razed to the ground, and their precious archives strewed the streets of
many cities. On the 17th of June 1244 twenty-four cartloads of these
ancient MSS. were burned in Paris alone. &ldquo;And all this by our
holy &lsquo;protector of learning&rsquo; through the Middle Ages!</p>
<p>The Japanese have pictures of a famous magician who conjured up a
demon&mdash;vast, vague, and terrible&mdash;out of his inkstand. They
call it latterly &lsquo;emblem of a licentious press,&rsquo; but, no
doubt, it was originally used to terrify the country generally
concerning the press. That Devil has also haunted the ecclesiastical
imagination in Europe. Nearly every book written without priestly
command was associated with the Devil, and there are several old books
in Europe, laboriously and honestly written, which to this day are
invested with popular superstitions reporting the denunciations with
which they were visited. For some centuries it has been believed in
Denmark and neighbouring countries that a strange and formidable book
exists, by means of which you can raise or lay the Devil. It is
vulgarly known as the <i>Book of Cyprianus</i>. The owner of it can
neither sell, bury, or burn it, and if he cannot get rid of it before
his death, he becomes the prey of the fiend. The only way of getting
rid of it is to find somebody who will accept it as a present, well
knowing what it is. Cyprianus is said to have been a clever and
virtuous young student, but he studied the black art in Norway, and
came under the power of the Devil, who compelled him to use his unholy
learning to evil ends. This grieved him sorely, and he wrote a book, in
which he shows first, how evil shall be done, and then how to
counteract it. The book is probably one which really exists or existed,
and professed to teach the art of sorcery, and likewise the charms
against it. It consists of three parts, severally called <i>Cyprianus,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>Dr. Faust</i>, and <i>Jacob Ramel</i>. The two
latter are written in cypher. It teaches everything appertaining to
&lsquo;signing,&rsquo; conjuring, second sight, and all the charms
alluded to in <a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut%2018:10-12&amp;version=NRSV">
Deuteronomy xviii. 10&ndash;12</a>. The person possessing
Cyprianus&rsquo; book is said never to be in need of money, and none
can harm him. The only way of getting rid of it is to put it away in a
secret place in a church along with a clerk&rsquo;s fee of four
shillings.</p>
<p>In Stockholm I saw the so-called <i>Devil&rsquo;s Bible</i>, the
biggest book in the world, in the Royal Library. It is literally as
they describe it, &lsquo;<i lang="la">gigas librorum</i>&rsquo;: no
single man can lift it from the floor. It was part of the booty carried
off by the Swedes after the surrender of Prague, <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1648. It contains three hundred parchment leaves, each
one made of an ass&rsquo;s hide, the cover being of oak planks,
1&frac12; inches thick. It contains the Old and New Testaments;
<i lang="la">Josephi Flavii Antiquitates Judaic&aelig;; Isidori
Episcopi L. XX. de diversis materiis; Confessio peccatorum</i>; and
some other works. The last-named production is written on black and
dark brown ground with red and yellow letters. Here and there sentences
are marked &lsquo;<i lang="la">h&aelig;c sunt suspecta</i>,&rsquo;
&lsquo;<i lang="la">superstitiosa</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i lang=
"la">prohibita</i>.&rsquo; One MS., which is headed, &lsquo;<i lang=
"la">Experimentum de furto et febribus</i>&rsquo;, is a treatise in
Monkish Latin on the exorcism of ghosts and evil spirits, charms
against thieves and sickness, and various prescriptions in &lsquo;White
Magic.&rsquo; The age of the book is considerably over three hundred
years. The autograph of a German emperor is in it: &lsquo;<span lang=
"la">Ferdinandus Imperator Romanorum</span>, <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 1577.&rsquo; The volume is known in Sweden as <i lang=
"se">Fan&rsquo;s Bibel</i> (Devil&rsquo;s Bible). The legend says, that
a monk, suspected of black arts, who had been condemned to death,
begged for life, and his judge mockingly told him that he would be
pardoned only if he should produce next morning all the books here
found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>and in this vast size. The monk invoked the
Devil&rsquo;s assistance, and the ponderous volume was written in a
single night. This Devil must have been one who prided himself more on
his literary powers than his personal appearance; for the face and form
said to be his portrait, frontispiece of the volume, represent a most
hideous ape, green and hairy, with horrible curled tusks. It is, no
doubt, the ape <i lang="de">Anerhahn</i> of the Wagner legends;
Burns&rsquo;s &lsquo;towzie tyke, black, grim, and
large.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5693src" href="#xd26e5693"
name="xd26e5693src">5</a></p>
<p>I noticed particularly in this old work the recurrence of deep red
letters and sentences similar to the ink which Fust used at the close
of his earliest printed volumes to give his name, with the place and
date of printing. Now Red is sacred in one direction as symbolising the
blood of Christ, but it is also the colour of Judas, who betrayed that
blood. Hence, while red letters might denote sacred days and sentences
in priestly calendars, they might be supposed mimicry of such
sanctities by &lsquo;God&rsquo;s Ape&rsquo; if occurring in secular
works or books of magic. It is said that these red letters were
especially noted in Paris as indications of the diabolical origin of
the works so easily produced by Fust; and, though it is uncertain
whether he suffered imprisonment, the red lines with his name appear to
have been regarded as his signature in blood.</p>
<p>For a long time every successive discovery of science, every
invention of material benefit to man, was believed by priest-ridden
peoples to have been secured by compact with the devil. The fate of the
artist Prometheus, fettered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href=
"#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>by jealous Jove, was repeated in
each who aspired to bring light to man, and some men of
genius&mdash;such as Cornelius Agrippa, and Paracelsus&mdash;appear to
have been frightened away from legitimate scientific research by the
first connection of their names with sorcery. They had before them the
example of the greatest scientific man of the Middle Ages, Roger Bacon,
and knew how easily, in the priestly whisper, the chemist&rsquo;s
crucible grew to a wizard&rsquo;s cauldron. The time may come when
Oxford University will have learned enough to build a true memorial of
the grandest man who ever wrote and taught within its walls. It would
show Roger Bacon&mdash;rectifier of the Julian Calendar, analyst of
lenses, inventor of spectacles and achromatic lenses, probable
constructor of the first telescope, demonstrator of the chemical action
of air in combustion, inventor of the mode of purifying saltpetre and
crystallising it into gunpowder, anticipator of the philosophical
method with which his namesake is credited&mdash;looking on a pile of
his books for whose researches he had paid two thousand French livres,
to say nothing of a life&rsquo;s labour, only to see them condemned by
his University, their circulation prohibited; and his sad gaze might be
from the prison to which the Council of Franciscans at Paris sentenced
him whom Oxford gladly delivered into their hands. He was condemned,
says their historian Wadding, &lsquo;<i lang="la">propter novitates
quasdam suspectas</i>.&rsquo; The suspected novelties were crucibles,
retorts, and lenses that made the stars look larger. So was it with the
Oxford six hundred years ago. Undeniably some progress had been made
even in the last generation, for Shelley was only forbidden to study
chemistry, and expelled for his metaphysics. But now that it is claimed
that Oxford is no longer partaker with them that stoned investigators
and thinkers from Bacon to Shelley, it would be in order to build for
its own great martyr of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=
"#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>science a memorial, that
superstition may look on one whom it has pierced.</p>

<p>Referring to Luther&rsquo;s inkstand thrown at the Devil, Dr.
Zerffii, in his lecture on the Devil, says, &lsquo;He (the devil) hates
nothing so much as writing or printer&rsquo;s ink.&rsquo; But the truth
of this remark depends upon which of two devils be considered. It would
hardly apply to the Serpent who recommended the fruit of knowledge, or
to the University man in Lucas van Leyden&rsquo;s picture (<a href=
"#fig06">Fig. 6</a>). But if we suppose the Devil of Luther&rsquo;s
Bible (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>) to be the one at which the
inkstand was thrown, the criticism is correct. The two pictures
mentioned may be instructively compared. Luther&rsquo;s Devil is the
reply of the University to the Church. These are the two
devils&mdash;the priest and the scholar&mdash;who glared at each other
in the early sixteenth century. &lsquo;The Devil smelled the
roast,&rsquo; says Luther, &lsquo;that if the languages revived, his
kingdom would get a hole which he could not easily stop again.&rsquo;
And it must be admitted that some of the monkish execrations of the
time, indeed of many times since, have an undertone of Jahvistic
jealousy. &lsquo;These Knowers will become as one of us.&rsquo; It must
also be admitted that the clerical instinct told true: the University
man held in him that sceptical devil who is always the destroyer of the
priest&rsquo;s paradise. These two devils which struggled with each
other through the sixteenth century still wage their war in the arena
of Protestantism. Many a Lutheran now living may remember to have
smiled when Hofmann&rsquo;s experiments in discovering carbonic acid
gas gained him repute for raising again Mephosto; but perhaps they did
not recognise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>Luther&rsquo;s devil when, at the annual
assembly of Lutheran Pastors in Berlin (Sept. 1877), he reappeared as
the Rev. Professor Grau, and said, &lsquo;Not a few listen to those
striving to combine Christ with Belial, to reconcile redeeming truth
with modern science and culture.&rsquo; But though they who take the
name of Luther in vain may thus join hands with the Devil, at whom the
Reformer threw his inkstand, the combat will still go on, and the
University Belial do the brave work of Bel till beneath his feet lies
the dragon of Darkness whether disguised as Pope or Protestant.</p>
<p>If the Church wishes to know precisely how far the roughness
pardonable in the past survives unpardonably in itself, let its clergy
peruse carefully the following translation by Mr. Leland of a poem by
Heine; and realise that the Devil portrayed in it is, by grace of its
own prelates, at present the most admired personage in every Court and
fashionable drawing-room in Christendom.</p>

Tertullian&rsquo;s phrase, &lsquo;The Devil is God&rsquo;s Ape,&rsquo;
became popular at one time, and the Ape-devil had frequent
representation in art&mdash;as, for instance, in Holbein&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Crucifixion&rsquo; (1477), now at Augsburg, where a Devil with
head of an ape, bat-wings, and flaming red legs is carrying off the

That little vision may report more than many more famous ones the
consistency with which the first christians had developed the doctrine
that nature is the incarnation of the Evil Spirit. It reports to us the
sense of many sounds and sights which were heard and seen by ears and
eyes trained for such and no other, all showing that the genii of
nature and beauty were vanishing from the earth. Over the &AElig;gean
sea were heard lamentations and the voice, &lsquo;Great Pan is
dead!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=

<p class="first">But while the rage of these Fathers towards all the
great gods and goddesses, who in their grand temples represented
&lsquo;the pride of life,&rsquo; was remorseless, they were
comparatively indifferent to the belief or disbelief of the lower
classes in their small tutelary divinities. They appear almost to have
encouraged belief in these, perhaps appreciating the advantages of the
popular custom of giving generous offerings to such personal and
domestic patrons. At a very early period there seems to have arisen an
idea of converting these more plebeian spirits into guardian angels
with christian names. Thus Jerome relates in his Life of the first
Hermit Paul, that when St. Anthony was on his way to visit that holy
man, he encountered a Centaur who pointed out the way; and next a
human-like dwarf with horns, hooked fingers, and feet like those of a
goat. St. Anthony believing this to be an apparition of the Devil, made
the sign of the Cross; but the little man, nowise troubled by this,
respectfully approached the monk, and having been asked who he was,
answered: &lsquo;I am a mortal, and one of those inhabitants of the
Desert whom the Gentiles in their error worship under the names of
Fauns, Satyrs, and Incubi: I am delegated by my people to ask of thee
to pray for us to our common God, who we know has descended for the
salvation of the world, and whose praises resound in all the
earth.&rsquo; At this glorification of Christ St. Anthony was
transported with joy, and turning towards Alexandria he cried,
&lsquo;Woe to thee, adulterous city, which adorest animals as
gods!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span></p>
<p>Perhaps the evolution of these desert demons into good christians
would have gone on more rapidly and completely if the primitive
theologians had known as much of their history as comparative mythology
has disclosed to the modern world. St. Anthony was, however, fairly on
the track of them when he turned towards Alexandria. Egypt appears to
have been the especial centre from which were distributed through the
world the fetish guardians of provinces, towns, households and
individuals. Their Serapes reappear in the Teraphim of Laban, and many
of the forms they used reappear in the Penates, Lares, and genii of
Latin countries. All these in their several countries were originally
related to its ancient religion or mythology, but before the christian
era they were very much the same in Egypt, Greece, and Italy. They were
shaped in many different, but usually natural forms, such as serpents,
dogs, boys, and old men, though often some intimation was given of
their demonic character. They were so multiplied that even plants and
animals had their guardians. The anthropomorphic genii called the
Patrii, who were supposed to preside over provinces, were generally
represented bearing weapons with which they defended the regions of
which they were patrons. These were the Averrunci or
Apotrop&aelig;i.</p>
<p>There are many interesting branches of this subject which cannot be
entered into here, and others have already been considered in the
foregoing parts of this work. It is sufficient for my present purpose
to remark, that, in the course of time, all the households of the world
had traditional guardians; these were generally represented in some
shape on amulets and talismans, on which were commonly inscribed the
verbal charms by which the patron could be summoned. In the process of
further time the amulets&mdash;especially such as were reproduced by
tribes migrating <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291"
name="pb291">291</a>]</span>from the vicinity of good
engravers&mdash;might be marked only with the verbal charms; these
again were, in the end, frequently represented only by some word or
name. This was the &lsquo;spell.&rsquo; Imagination fails in the effort
to conceive how many strata of extinct deities had bequeathed to the
ancient Egyptians those mystical names whose exact utterance they
believed would constrain each god so named to appear and bind him to
serve the invoker&rsquo;s purpose whether good or evil.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5810src" href="#xd26e5810" name="xd26e5810src">2</a>
This idea continued among the Jews and shaped the commandment,
&lsquo;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was in these diminutive forms that great systems survived among
the common people. Amid natural convulsions ancient formations of faith
were broken into fragments; in the ebb and flow of time these fragments
were smoothed, as it were, into these talismanic pebbles. Yet each of
these conveyed all the virtue which had been derived from the great and
costly ceremonial system from which it originally crumbled; the virtue
of soothing the mind and calming the nerves of sufferers with the
feeling that, though they might have been assailed by hostile powers,
they had friendly powers too who were active in their
behalf&mdash;Vindicators, to recall Job&rsquo;s phrase&mdash;who at
last would stand by them to the end. In the further ebb and flow of
generations the mass of such charms are further pulverised into sand or
into mud; but not all of them: amid the mud will be found many
surviving specimens, and such mud of accumulated superstitions is
always susceptible of being remoulded after such lingering models,
should occasion demand.</p>
<p>Erasmus, in his &lsquo;Adages,&rsquo; suggests that it was from
these genii of &lsquo;the Gentiles&rsquo; that the christians derived
their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>notion of each person being attended by two
angels, a good and a bad. Probably he was but half right. The peoples
to whom he refers did not generally believe that each man was attended
by a bad spirit, a personal enemy. That was an honour reserved for
individuals particularly formidable to the evil powers,&mdash;Adam,
Jacob, Hercules, or Zoroaster. The one preternatural power attending
each ordinary individual defended him from the general forces of evil.
But it was Christianity which, in the gradual effort to substitute
patron-saints and guardian-angels of its own for the pagan genii,
turned the latter from friends to enemies, and their protecting into
assailing weapons.</p>
<p>All the hereditary household gods of what is now called Christendom
were diabolised. But in order that the masses might turn from them and
invoke christian guardians, the Penates, Lares, and genii had to be
belittled on the one hand, and the superior power of the saints and
angels demonstrated. When Christianity had gained the throne of
political power, it was easy to show that the &lsquo;imps,&rsquo; as
the old guardians were now called, could no longer protect their
invokers from christian punishment, or confer equal favours.</p>
<p>Christianity conquered Europe by the sword, but at first that sword
was not wielded against the humble masses. It was wielded against their
proud oppressors. To the common people it brought glad tidings of a new
order, in which, under the banner of a crucified working-man and his
(alleged) peasant mother, all caste should disappear but that of piety
and charity. Christ eating with publicans and sinners and healing the
wayside cripples reappeared in St. Martin dividing his embroidered
cloak with a beggar&mdash;type of a new aristocracy. They who
worshipped the Crucified Peasant in the rock-cave of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>Tours which St. Martin had consecrated, or in
little St. Martin&rsquo;s Church at Canterbury where Bertha was
baptized, could not see the splendid cathedrals now visible from them,
built of their bones and cemented with their blood. King Ethelbert
surrendered the temple of his idol to the consecration of Augustine,
and his baptized subjects had no difficulty in seeing the point of the
ejected devil&rsquo;s talons on the wall which he assailed when the
first mass was therein celebrated.</p>
<p>Glad tidings to the poor were these that the persecuted first
missionaries brought to Gaul, Britain, and Germany. But they did not
last. The christians and the pagan princes, like Herod and Pilate,
joined hands to crucify the European peasant, and he was reduced to a
worse serfdom than he had suffered before. Every humble home in Europe
was trampled in the mire in the name of Christ. The poor man&rsquo;s
wife and child, and all he possessed were victims of the workman of
Jerusalem turned destroyer of his brethren. Michelet has well traced
Witchcraft to the Despair of the Middle Ages.<a class="noteref" id=

the old religions, which Christianity had made too rapid for it to be
complete, had left, as we have seen, all the trains laid for that
terrible explosion; and now its own hand of cruelty brought the torch
to ignite them. Let us, at risk of some iteration, consider some of
these combustible elements.</p>

<p>In the first place the Church had recognised the existence of the
pagan gods and <span class="corr" id="xd26e5843" title=
"Source: godesses">goddesses</span>, not wishing to imbreed in the
popular mind a sceptical habit, and also having use for them to excite
terror. Having for this latter purpose carved and painted them as ugly
and bestial, it became further of importance that they should be
represented as stupid and comparatively impotent. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span>Baptism could exorcise them, and a crucifix put
thousands of them to flight. This tuition was not difficult. The
peasantries of Europe had readily been induced to associate the newly
announced (christian) Devil with their most mischievous demons. But we
have already considered the forces under which these demons had entered
on their decline before they were associated with Satan. Many conquered
obstructions had rendered the Demons which represented them ridiculous.
Hence the &lsquo;Dummeteufel&rsquo; of so many German fables and of the
medi&aelig;val miracle-plays. &lsquo;No greater proof,&rsquo; says Dr.
Dasent, &lsquo;can be given of the small hold which the christian Devil
has taken of the Norse mind, than the heathen aspect under which he
constantly appears, and the ludicrous way in which he is always
outwitted.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5848src" href="#xd26e5848"
name="xd26e5848src">4</a> &lsquo;The Germans,&rsquo; says Max
M&uuml;ller, &lsquo;indoctrinated with the idea of a real devil, the
Semitic Satan or Diabolus, treated him in the most good-humoured
manner.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5851src" href="#xd26e5851"

title="Source: accompaning">accompanying</span> picture (<a href=

possession of Sir Joseph Hooker is illuminated. It could not be
expected that the masses would fear beings whom their priests thus held
up to ridicule. It is not difficult to imagine the process of evolution
by which the horns of such insignificant devils turned to the asinine
ears of such devils as this stall carving at Corbeil, near Paris
(<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>), which represented the popular view
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>of the mastery obtained by witches over devils.
It must be remembered also that this power over devils was in
accordance with the traditions concerning Solomon, and the subserviency
of Oriental demons generally to the lamps or charms to which they were
bound.</p>

<p>What the popular christian devil had become in all the Northern
nations is sufficiently shown in the figure he presented in most of the
old miracle-plays and &lsquo;Moralities.&rsquo; &lsquo;The Devill in
his fethers all ragged and rent,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5875src" href="#xd26e5875" name="xd26e5875src">6</a> had horns,
wide mouth, long (sometimes up-turned) nose, red beard, cloven foot,
and tail. He was attended by a buffoon called Vice. &lsquo;And,&rsquo;
says Harsenet, &lsquo;it was a pretty part in the old Church playes
when the nimble Vice would skip up nimbly like a Jackanapes into the
Devil&rsquo;s necke, and ride the Devil a course, and belabour him with
a wooden dagger, till he made him roar, whereat the people would laugh
to see the Devil so Vice-haunted.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5878src" href="#xd26e5878" name="xd26e5878src">7</a> The two must
have nearly resembled the clown and his unhappy victim Pantaloon in our
pantomimes, as to their antics. It would seem that sometimes holy
personages were caricatured in the make-up of the stage-devil. Thus in
&lsquo;Gammer Gurton&rsquo;s Needle&rsquo; we have this
conversation:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">In the scene of Christ&rsquo;s delivering souls from
purgatory, the Devil is represented as blowing lustily a horn to alarm
his comrades, and crying, &lsquo;Out, out, aronzt!&rsquo; to the
invader. He fights with a three-pronged fork. He and his victims are
painted black,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5903src" href="#xd26e5903"
name="xd26e5903src">8</a> in contrast with the souls of the saved,
which are white. The hair was considered very important.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5906src" href="#xd26e5906" name="xd26e5906src">9</a>
When he went to battle, even his fiery nature was sometimes represented
in a way that must have been more ludicrous than impressive.<a class=

<p>The insignificance to which the priests had reduced the devil in the
plays, where they were usually the actors, reflected their own petty
routine of life. They could conceive of nothing more terrible than
their own mean mishaps and local obstructions. One great office of the
Devil was to tempt some friar to sleep when he should be at
prayer,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5938src" href="#xd26e5938" name=
"xd26e5938src">11</a> make another drink too much, or a third cast warm
glances at a village beauty. The <i>Revelations</i> of the Abbot
Richalmus, written seven hundred years ago, shows the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>Devil already far gone in his process of
diminution. The Devil here concentrates the energies which once made
the earth tremble on causing nausea to the Abbot, and making the choir
cough while he is preaching. &lsquo;When I sit down to holy
studies,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;the devils make me heavy with sleep.
Then I stretch my hands beyond my cuffs to give them a chill. Forthwith
the spirits prick me under my clothes like so many fleas, which causes
me to put my hands on them; and so they get warm again, and my reading
grows careless.&rsquo; &lsquo;Come, just look at my lip; for twenty
years has an imp clung to it just to make it hang down.&rsquo; It is
ludicrous to find that ancient characteristic of the gods of Death
already adverted to&mdash;their hatred of salt, the agent of
preservation&mdash;descended from being the sign of Job&rsquo;s
constancy to Jehovah into a mere item of the Abbot&rsquo;s appetite.
&lsquo;When I am at dinner, and the devil has taken away my appetite,
as soon as I have tasted a little salt it comes back to me; and if,
shortly afterwards, I lose it again, I take some more salt, and am once
more an hungered.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5946src" href=
"#xd26e5946" name="xd26e5946src">12</a></p>
<p>One dangerous element was the contempt into which, by many causes,
the infernal powers had been brought. But a more dangerous one lay in
another direction. Though the current phrases of the New Testament and
of the Fathers of the Church, declaring this world, its wealth, loves,
and pleasures, to be all the kingdom of Satan, had become cant in the
mouths of priests ruling over Europe, it had never been cant to the
humble peasantries. Although they had degraded many devils imported by
the priests, it had been in connection with the declining terrors of
their native demonologies. But above these degraded and hated gnomes
and elves, whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298"
name="pb298">298</a>]</span>paternity had been transferred from
S&oelig;tere to Satan, there was an array of beautiful
deities&mdash;gentle gods and goddesses traditionally revered and loved
as protectors of the home and the family&mdash;which had never really
lost their hold on the common people. They might have shrunk before the
aggressive victories of the Saints into little Fairies, but their
continued love for the poor and the oppressed was the romance of every
household. What did these good fairies do? They sometimes loaded the
lowly with wealth, if summoned in just the right way; they sang secrets
to them from trees as little birds, they smoothed the course of love,
clothed ash-maidens in fine clothes, transported people through the
air, enabled them to render themselves invulnerable, or invisible, to
get out of prisons, to vanquish &lsquo;the powers that be,&rsquo;
whether &lsquo;ordained of God&rsquo; or not. Now all these were
benefits which, by christian theory, could only be conferred by that
Prince of this World who ministered to &lsquo;the pride of
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Into homes which the priest and his noble had stripped of happiness
and hope,&mdash;whose loving brides were for baptized Bluebeards, whose
hard earnings were taken as the price of salvation from devils whose
awfulness was departing,&mdash;there came from afar rumours of great
wealth and splendour conferred upon their worshippers by Eastern gods
and goddesses. The priests said all those were devils who would torture
their devotees eternally after death; yet it could not be denied that
the Moors had the secret of lustres and ornamentation, that the heathen
East was gorgeous, that all Christendom was dreaming of the wealth of
Ormus and of Ind. Granted that Satan had come westward and northward,
joined the scurvy crew of Loki, and become of little importance; but
what of Baal or Beelzebub, of Asmodeus, of the genii who built
Solomon&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299"
name="pb299">299</a>]</span>temple, of rich Pluto, of august Ahriman?
Along with stories of Oriental magnificence there spread through
Christendom names of many deities and demons; many of them beautiful
names, too, euphemism having generally managed to bestow melodious
epithets alike on deities feared and loved. In Faust&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Miraculous Art and Book of Marvels, or the Black Raven&rsquo;
(1469), the infernal heirarchy are thus named:&mdash;<i>King</i>,
Lucifer; <i>Viceroy</i>, Belial; <i>Gubernatores</i>, Satan, Beelzebub,
Astaroth, Pluto; <i>Chief Princes</i>, Aziel, Mephistopheles, Marbuel,
Ariel, Aniguel, Anisel, Barfael. Seductive meanings, too, corresponding
to these names, had filtered in some way from the high places they once
occupied into the minds of the people. Lucifer was a fallen star that
might rise again; Belial and Beelzebub were princes of the fire that
rendered possible the arts of man, and the Belfires never went out in
the cold North; Astarte meant beauty, and Pluto wealth; Aziel (Asael)
was President of the great College of occult arts, from whom Solomon
learned the secrets by which he made the jinni his slaves; Marbuel was
the artist and mechanic, sometimes believed to aid artisans who
produced work beyond ordinary human skill; Ariel was the fine spirit of
the air whose intelligence corresponded to that of the Holy Ghost on
the other side; Aniguel is the serpent of Paradise, generally written
Anisel; Anizazel is probably a fanciful relative of Azazel, &lsquo;the
strong god;&rsquo; and Barfael, who in a later Faust book is Barbuel,
is an orientalised form of the &lsquo;demon of the long beard&rsquo;
who holds the secret of the philosopher&rsquo;s stone.</p>
<p>In a later chapter the growth of favourable views of the devil is
considered. Some of the legends therein related may be instructively
read in connection with the development of Witchcraft. Many rumours
were spread abroad of kindly assistance brought by demons to persons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>in distress. But even more than by hopes so
awakened was the witch aided by the burning desire of the people for
vengeance. They wanted Zamiel (Sama&euml;l) to help them to mould the
bullet that would not miss its mark. The Devil and all his angels had
long been recognised by their catechists as being utilised by the Deity
to execute his vengeance on the guilty; and to serfs in their agony
that devil who would not spare prince or priest was more desired than
even the bestower of favours to their starving minds and bodies.</p>
<p>Under the long ages of war in Europe, absorbing the energies of men,
women had become the preservers of letters. The era of witchcraft in
Europe found that sex alone able to read and write, arts disesteemed in
men, among the peasantry at least. To them men turned when it had
become a priestly lesson that a few words were more potent than the
weapons of princes. Besides this, women were the chief sorcerers,
because they were the chief sufferers. In Alsace (1615), out of
seventy-five who perished as witches, sixty-two were women. The famous
<i>Malleus Maleficorum</i>, which did more evil than any work ever
published, derives <i>femina</i> from <i>fide minus</i>. Although in
the Faust legend Mephistopheles objects to marriage, many stories
represent diabolical weddings. Particular details were told of the
marriage of Satan with the daughter of a Sorceress at Egnischen (1585),
on which occasion the three towers of the castle there were said to
have been illuminated, and a splendid banquet spread, the favourite
dish being a ragout of bats. There was exquisite music, and a
&lsquo;beautiful man&rsquo; blessed the nuptials. How many poor peasant
girls must have had such dreams as they looked up from their drudgery
to the brilliant chateaux?</p>

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 20.&mdash;<span class="sc">Lilith as
Cat.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the illuminated manuscript known as &lsquo;Queen Mary&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>Psalter&rsquo; (1553) there is a picture of the
Fall of Man (<a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>) which possesses far-reaching
significance. It is a modification of that idea, which gained such wide
currency in the Middle Ages, that it was the serpent-woman Lilith who
had tempted Adam to eat the forbidden fruit. In this picture, while the
beautiful face and ample hair of Lilith are given, instead of the usual
female bust she has the body of a cat. This nocturnal animal, already
sacred to Freyja, the Teutonic Venus, whose chariot it drew, gained a
new mythological career in the North by the large number of Southern
and Oriental stones which related it to the lunar and amorous
demonesses. When the gods fled before the Titans, Diana, as Ovid
relates, changed herself to a cat, and as infernal Hecate that animal
was still beside her. If my reader will turn to vol. i. p. 130, some of
the vast number of myths which prepared the cat to take its place as
familiar of the witch may be found. Whether the artist had Lilith in
his mind or not, the illumination in &lsquo;Queen Mary&rsquo;s
Psalter&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>represents a remarkable association of myths.
For Lilith was forerunner of the medi&aelig;val mothers weeping for
their children; her voice of perpetual lamentation at the cruel fate
allotted her by the combined tyranny of God and man was heard on every
sighing wind; and she was the richly dressed bride of the Prince of
Devils, ever seeking to tempt youth. Such stories floated through the
mind of the Middle Ages, and this infernal Madonna is here seen in
association with the cat, beneath whose soft sparkling fur the goddess
of Love and Beauty was supposed to be still lurking near the fireside
of many a miserable home. Some fragrance of the mystical East was with
this feline beauty, and nothing can be more striking than the contrast
which the ordinary devils beside her present. Their unseductive
ugliness and meanness is placed out of sight of the pair tempted to
seek the fruit of forbidden knowledge. They inspire the man and woman
in their evidently eager grasping after the fruit, which here means the
consultation of fair fortune-tellers and witches to obtain that occult
knowledge for which speculative men are seeking in secret studies and
laboratories.</p>
<p>Those who have paid attention to the subject of Witchcraft need not
be reminded that its complexity and vastness would require a larger
volume than the present to deal with it satisfactorily. The present
study must be limited to a presentation of some of the facts which
induce the writer to believe that, beneath the phenomena, lay a
profound alienation from Christianity, and an effort to recall the
banished gods which it had superseded.</p>
<p>The first christian church was mainly Jewish, and this is also to
say that it inherited the vast Angelolatry and the system of spells
which that tribe had brought from Babylon. To all this was now
superadded the accumulation of Assyrian and Egyptian lore which was
re-edited in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303"
name="pb303">303</a>]</span>form of Neoplatonicism. This mongrel mass,
constituted of notions crumbled from many systems, acquired a certain
consistency in Gnosticism. The ancient Egyptians had colleges set apart
for astrological study, and for cultivation of the art of healing by
charms. Every month, decade, day of the year had its special guardian
in the heavens. The popular festivals were astronomic. To the priests
in the colleges were reserved study of the sacred books in which the
astrological secrets were contained, and whose authorship was
attributed to the god Thoth, inventor of writing, the Greek Hermes,
and, later, Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus. The zodiac is a memorial of
the influence which the stars were supposed to exert upon the human
body. Alchemy (the word is Egyptian, <i>K&eacute;mi</i> meaning
&lsquo;black earth&rsquo;) was also studied in connection with solar,
lunar, and stellar influences. The Alchemists dreamed of discovering
the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, which would change base metals to gold;
and Diocletian, in burning the Alchemists&rsquo; books, believed that,
in so doing, he would deprive the Egyptians of their source of
wealth.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6018src" href="#xd26e6018" name=
"xd26e6018src">13</a></p>
<p>Imported into Greece, these notions and their cult had a twofold
development. Among the Platonists they turned to a naturalistic and
allegorical Demonology; among the uncultivated they formed a
Diabolarchy, which gathered around the terrible lunar
phantasm&mdash;Hecate.</p>
<p>The astrological College of Egypt gave to the Jews their strange
idea of the high school maintained among the devils, already referred
to in connection with Asmodeus, who was one of its leading professors.
The rabbinical legend was, that two eminent angels, Asa and Asael,
remonstrated with the Creator on having formed man only to give
trouble. The Creator said they would have done the same as man under
similar circumstances; whereupon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb304"
href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>Asa and Asael proposed that
the experiment should be tried. They went to earth, and the
Creator&rsquo;s prediction was fulfilled: they were the first
&lsquo;sons of God&rsquo; who fell in love with the daughters of men
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%206:2&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
vi. 2</a>). They were then embodied. In heaven they had been angels of
especial knowledge in divine arts, and they now used their spells to
reascend. But their sin rendered the spells powerless for that, so they
repaired to the Dark Mountains, and there established a great College
of Sorcery. Among the many distinguished graduates of this College were
Job, Jethro, and Bileam. It was believed that these three instructed
the soothsayers who attempted to rival the miracles of Moses before
Pharaoh. Job and Jethro were subsequently converted, but Bileam
continued his hostility to Israel, and remains a teacher in the
College. Through knowledge of the supreme spell&mdash;the
<i>Shem-hammphor&aacute;sch</i>, or real name of God&mdash;Solomon was
able to chain Professor Asmodeus, and wrest from him the secret of the
worm Sch&aacute;mir, by whose aid the Temple was built.</p>
<p>Traditions of the learning of the Egyptians, and of the marvels
learned by Solomon from Asa and Asael by which he compelled demons to
serve him, and the impressive story of the Witch of Endor, powerfully
influenced the inquisitive minds of Europe. The fierce denunciations of
all studies of these arts of sorcery by the early Church would alone
reveal how prevalent they were. The wonderful story of Apollonius of
Tyana,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6035src" href="#xd26e6035" name=
"xd26e6035src">14</a> as told by Philostratus, was really a kind of
gospel to the more worldly-minded scholars. Some rabbins, following the
outcry against Jesus, &lsquo;He casteth out devils by Beelzebub,&rsquo;
circulated at an early date the story that Jesus had derived his power
to work miracles from the spell <i>Shem-hammphor&aacute;sch</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>which he found on one of the stones of the
Temple where Solomon had left it. Though Eusebius cast doubt upon them,
the christians generally do not appear to have denied the miracles of
Apollonius, which precisely copy those of Jesus from the miraculous
birth to the ascension, but even to have quoted them as an evidence of
the possibility of miracles. Celsus having attributed the miracles of
Jesus to sorcery, and said that magic influenced only the ignorant and
immoral, Origen replies that, in order to convince himself of the
contrary, he has only to read the memoirs of Apollonius by
M&aelig;ragenes, who speaks of him as a philosopher and magician, who
repeatedly exercised his powers on philosophers. Arnobius and the
fathers of the fourth century generally believed in the Apollonian
thaumaturgy and attributed it to magic. Aldus Manutius published the
book of Philostratus in the fifteenth century, and the degree to which
the fascinating and marvellous stories concerning Apollonius fired the
European imagination just awaking under the breath of the Renaissance,
may be estimated by the fury with which the &lsquo;magician&rsquo; was
anathematised by Pico della Mirandola, Jean Bodin, and Baronius. The
book and the controversy attracted much attention, and while the
priests still continued to charge Apollonius with being a
&lsquo;magician,&rsquo; they appear to have perceived that it would
have been more to the point, so far as their real peril was concerned,
to have proved him an impostor. Failing that, Dr. Faustus and his
fellow-professors in the &lsquo;black art&rsquo; were left masters of
the situation. The people had to digest the facts admitted, that a
Pagan had learned, by initiations into the astrological schools of
Egypt and India, the means of healing the sick, raising the dead,
flying through the air, throwing off chains, opening locks, rendering
himself invisible, and discerning the future. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span></p>
<p>There was a call for some kind of Apollonius, and Faustus arose.
Side by side flourished Luther and Faustus. To Roman Catholic eyes they
were twin sons of the Devil;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6046src" href=
"#xd26e6046" name="xd26e6046src">15</a> that they were characteristic
products of one moral age and force appears to me certain, even as
to-day the negations of Science and the revival of
&lsquo;Spiritualism&rsquo; have a common root in radical disbelief of
the hereditary dogmas and forms of so-called religion. It is, however,
not surprising that Protestantism felt as much horror of its bastard
brother as Science has of the ghostly seances. Through the early
sixteenth century we can trace this strange Dr. Faustus
(&lsquo;auspicious,&rsquo; he had chosen that name) going about
Germany, not omitting Erfurth, and talking in taverns about his magic
arts and powers. More is said of him in the following chapter; it is
sufficient to observe here, and it is the conclusion of Professor
Morley, who has sifted the history with his usual care, that about him,
as a centre of crystallisation, tales ascribed in the first place to
other conjurers arranged themselves, until he became the popular ideal
of one who sought to sound the depths of this world&rsquo;s knowledge
and enjoyments without help from the Church or its God. The priests did
not doubt that this could be done, nor did the Protestants; they
generally agreed that it could be accomplished at cost of the soul. As
angels of the good God must answer to the formulas of invocation to
those who had made a sacramental compact with their Chief, so was it
possible to share a sacrament of Satan, and by certain invocations
summon his infernal angels to obtain the pleasures of this world of
which he is Prince. A thousand years&rsquo; experience of the Church
had left the poor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307"
name="pb307">307</a>]</span>ready to sign the compact if they could
secure some little earthly joy. As for Heaven, if it were anything like
what its ministers had provided for the poor on earth, Hell might be
preferable after all.</p>
<p>Dr. Wuttke, while writing his recent work on German superstitions,
was surprised to learn that there still exist in France and in
Wurtemberg schools for teaching the Black Art. A priest in the
last-named country wrote him that a boy had confessed to having passed
the lower grade of such a school, but, scared by the horrid ceremonies,
had pronounced some holy words which destroyed the effect of the wicked
practices, and struck the assembled Devil-worshippers with
consternation. The boy said he had barely escaped with his life. I have
myself passed an evening at a school in London &lsquo;for the
development of Spirit-mediums,&rsquo; and possibly Dr. Wuttke&rsquo;s
correspondent would describe these also as Devil-worshippers. No doubt
all such circles might be traced arch&aelig;ologically to that
Sorcerers&rsquo; College said by the rabbins to have been kept by Asa
and Asael. But what moral force preserved them? They do but represent a
turning of methods made familiar by the Church to coax benefits from
other supernatural powers in the hope that they would be less dilatory
than the Trinity in bestowing their gifts. What is the difference
between St. Wolfram&rsquo;s God and King Radbot&rsquo;s Devil? The one
offers a golden mansion on earth warranted to last through eternity,
the other a like mansion in the skies receivable after death. The Saint
agrees that if Radbot&rsquo;s Devil can build him such a house the king
would be quite right to worship the architect. The question of the
comparative moral merits of the two invisible Powers is not mentioned.
This legend, related in a preceding chapter, is characteristic of the
motives to which the priesthood appealed through the Middle Ages.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>It is no wonder that the people began to appeal
to the gods of their traditional Radbots, nor that they should have
used the ceremonial and sacramental formulas around them.</p>
<p>But to these were added other formulas borrowed from different
sources. The &lsquo;Compact with the Devil&rsquo; had in it various
elements. It appears to have been a custom of the Odinistic religion
for men to sign acts of self-dedication to trusted deities, somewhat
corresponding to the votive tablets of Southern religion. It was a
legend of Odin that when dying he marked his arm with the point of a
spear, and this may have been imitated. In the &lsquo;Mysteries&rsquo;
of pagan and christian systems blood played an important part&mdash;the
human blood of earlier times being symbolised by that of animals, and
ultimately, among christians, in wine of the Eucharist. The primitive
history of this blood-covenant is given in another chapter. Some
astrological formulas, and many of the deities invoked, spread through
Europe with the Jews. The actual, and quite as often fabulous, wealth
of that antichristian race was ascribed to Antichrist, and while
christian princes thought of such gold as legitimate spoil, the honest
peasants sought from their astrologers the transmitted &lsquo;key of
Solomon,&rsquo; in virtue of which the demons served him. The famous
&lsquo;Compact&rsquo; therefore was largely of christian-judaic origin,
and only meant conveyance of the soul in consideration of precisely the
same treasures as those promised by the Church to all whose names were
written in the Lamb&rsquo;s Book,&mdash;the only difference being in
the period when redemption of the respective issues of priest and
astrologer should fall due. One was payable during this life, the other
after death.</p>
<p>The ceremonial performances of Witchcraft have also always existed
in some form. What we are familiar with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb309" href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>of late as
Spirit-seances are by no means new. More than a hundred years ago, Mr.
Wesley and various clergymen were sitting at a table in Cock Lane,
asking the spirit &lsquo;Fanny&rsquo; to rap twice if she were
&lsquo;in a state of progressive happiness.&rsquo; Nay, a hundred years
before that (1661), Sir Thomas Chamberlain and others, sitting in a
haunted house at Tedworth, Wilts, asked &lsquo;Satan, if the Drummer
set thee to work, give three knocks, and no more, which it did very
distinctly, and stopped.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6065src"
href="#xd26e6065" name="xd26e6065src">16</a> We also learn that, in
another town and case (1654), &lsquo;a naked arm and hand appeared and
beat the floor.&rsquo; It would not be difficult to go further back and
find that the dark circle of our Spiritualists with much of its
apparatus has existed continuously through the Middle Ages. The dark
seance which Goethe has represented in Faust, Part II., at which the
spirits of Helen and Paris are evoked, is a very accurate picture of
the &lsquo;materialisations&rsquo; now exhibited by mediums, more than
forty years after its publication. These outer resemblances are
physiognomical. The seance of to-day has lost the darker features of
its medi&aelig;val prototype, because the Present has not a real and
temporal, but only a speculative and sentimental despair, and this is
the kind that possesses chiefly the well-to-do and idle classes. It is
not difficult to meet the eye of our everyday human nature amid those
frenzied periods when whole districts seemed afflicted with epidemic
madness, and look deep in that eye to the fathomless heart of
humanity.</p>
<p>In an old parish register of Fewston, Yorkshire, are the following
entries:&mdash;&lsquo;1621. Anne, daughter of Edward Fairfax, baptized
the 12th June.&rsquo; &lsquo;1621. Edward Fairfax, Esq., a child named
Anne, buried the 9th October.&rsquo; Then in the History of
Knaresborough we read of this child, &lsquo;She was held to have died
through witchcraft.&rsquo; In what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310"
href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>dreams did that child,
supposed to have been snatched away by diabolic malice, return as a
pure spirit uplifted in light, yet shadowed by the anxiety and pain of
the bereaved family! A medium is at hand, one through whose mind and
heart all the stormy electricities of the time are playing. The most
distinguished representative of the Fairfax family is off fighting for
Parliament against the King. Edward Fairfax is a zealous Churchman. His
eldest daughter, Helen, aged twenty-one, is a parishioner of the Rev.
Mr. Smithson, yet she has come under the strong influence of a
Nonconformist preacher, Mr. Cook. The scholarly clergyman and his
worldly Church on one side, and the ignorant minister with his humble
followers on the other, are unconscious personifications of Vice and
Virtue, while between them poor Helen is no Heraklea.</p>
<p>Nineteen days after the burial of her little sister Anne, as
mentioned above, Helen is found &lsquo;in a deadly trance.&rsquo; After
a little she begins to speak, her words showing that she is, by
imagination, &lsquo;in the church at Leeds, hearing a sermon by Mr.
Cook.&rsquo; On November 3, as she lies on her bed, Helen exclaims,
&lsquo;A white cat hath been long upon me and drawn my breath, and hath
left in my mouth and throat so filthy a smell that it doth poison
me!&rsquo; Next we have the following in the father&rsquo;s diary:
&lsquo;<i>Item.</i> Upon Wednesday, the 14th of November, she saw a
black dog by her bedside, and, after a little sleep, she had an
apparition of one like a young gentleman, very brave, his apparel all
laid with gold lace, a hat with a golden band, and a ruff in fashion.
He did salute her with the same compliment as she said Sir Fernandino
Fairfax useth when he cometh to the house and saluteth her
mother&#8202;&hellip;. He said he was a Prince, and would make her
Queen of England and of all the world if she would go with him. She
refused, and said, &lsquo;In the name of God, what art thou?&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311</a>]</span>He presently did forbid her to name God; to
which she replied, &lsquo;Thou art no man if thou canst not abide the
name of God; but if thou be a man, come near, let me feel of
thee;&rsquo; which he would not do, but said, &lsquo;It is no matter
for feeling.&rsquo; She proceeded, &lsquo;If thou wert a man, thou
wouldst not deny to be felt; but thou art the devil, and art but a
shadow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is possible that Helen Fairfax had read in Shakspere&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Lear,&rsquo; printed twelve years before, that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman;</p>
<p class="line">Modo he&rsquo;s called, and Mahu.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6086src" href="#xd26e6086" name="xd26e6086src">17</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the reader will remark how her vision anticipates
that of Faust, the transformation of the poodle to finely-dressed
Mephistopheles. On the next apparition a bit from Patmos is
interpolated, the Devil appearing as a beast with many horns; but the
folklore of Yorkshire prevails, and &lsquo;presently he was like a very
little dog, and desired her to open her mouth and let him come into her
body, and then he would rule all the world.&rsquo; Lastly, he
&lsquo;filled the room with fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the account thus far we have the following items of ancient
mythology:&mdash;1, the Cat; 2, the Dog; 3, the Pride of Life
(Asmodeus), represented in the fine dress and manners of the fiend; 4,
the Prince of this World, offering its throne; 5, the Egyptian belief
in potency of the Name; 6, the Hunger-Demon, who dares not be felt,
because his back is hollow, and, though himself a shadow, casts none;
7, the disembodied devil of the rabbins, who seeks to enter a human
form, in order to enjoy the higher powers of which man is capable; 8,
the fiend of fire.</p>
<p>The period in which Helen Fairfax lived supplied forms <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>for
the &lsquo;materialisation&rsquo; of these notions flitting from the
ancient cemeteries of theology. The gay and gallant Asmodeus had been
transformed into a goat under the ascetic eye of Europe; his mistress
is a naked witch; her familiar and slave is a cat. This is the
conventionalised theologic theory, as we find it in many examples, one
of which is here shown (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>), as copied from a
stone panel at the entrance of Lyons Cathedral. This is what
Helen&rsquo;s visions end in. She and her younger sister of seven
years, and a young neighbour, a girl of twelve, who have become
infected with Helen&rsquo;s hysterics, identify six poor women as
witches, and Edward Fairfax would have secured their execution had it
not been for the clergyman Smithson.</p>

</div>
<p>Cats played a large part in this as in other witch-trials. They had
long been regarded as an insurance of humble households. In many
regions still may be found beliefs that a three-coloured cat protects
against fire; a black cat cures epilepsy, protects gardens; and in
Bohemia a cat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>is the favourite bridal gift to procure a happy
wedded life. One who kills a cat has no luck for seven years. The
Yorkshire women called witches remembered these proverbs to their cost.
Among the cats regarded by the Fairfaxes as familiars of the accused,
some names are notable. One is called &lsquo;Gibbe.&rsquo; This is the
Icelandic <i>gabba</i>, to &lsquo;delude,&rsquo; and our gibber; it is
the &lsquo;Gib&rsquo; cat of Reinicke Fuchs, and of the &lsquo;Romaunt
of the Rose.&rsquo; In &lsquo;Gammer Gurton&rsquo; we read, &lsquo;Hath
no man gelded Gyb, her cat;&rsquo; and in Henry IV. i. 2, &lsquo;I am
as melancholy as a gib cat.&rsquo; Another of the cats is called
<i>Inges</i>. That is, <i>ignis</i>, fire&mdash;Agni maintaining his
reign of terror.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s devil hates the dissenter, and says, &lsquo;Cook is a
lying villain,&rsquo; because Cook exorcises him with a psalm. On the
other hand, the devil praises the clergyman, but Helen breaks out with
&lsquo;He is not worthy to be a vicar who will bear with
witches.&rsquo; Amid the religious controversies then exciting all
households, mourning for his dead child, humiliated by the suspicions
of his best neighbours that his daughter was guilty of deception,
Edward Fairfax, Gentleman, a scholar and author, lent an ear to the
vulgar superstitions of his neighbourhood. Could he have stood on the
shoulders of Grimm, he would have left us a very different narrative
than that preserved by the Philobiblion Society.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6124src" href="#xd26e6124" name="xd26e6124src">18</a></p>
<p>It is hardly possible to determine now the value of the alleged
confessions of witches. They were extorted by torture or by promises of
clemency (the latter rarely fulfilled); they were shaped by
cross-examiners rather than by their victims; and their worth is still
more impaired where, as is usual, they are not given in detail, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>recorded in &lsquo;substance,&rsquo; the
phraseology in such case reflecting the priest&rsquo;s preconceived
theory of witches and their orgies. It is to be feared, for instance,
that &lsquo;devil&rsquo; is often written instead of some name that
might now be interesting. Nevertheless, there seems to be ground for
believing that in many cases there were seances held to invoke
supernatural powers.</p>
<p>Among the vast number of trials and confessions, I have found none
more significant than the following. In February 1691 a daughter and
niece of Mr. Parris, minister in Salem (Massachusetts), girls of ten or
eleven years, and several other girls, complained of various bodily
torments, and as the physicians could find no cause for them, they were
pronounced bewitched. The Rev. Mr. Parris had once been in business at
the Barbadoes, and probably brought thence his two slaves, Spanish
Indians, man and wife. When the children were declared bewitched, the
Indian woman, Tituba, tried an experiment, probably with fetishes
familiar in the Barbadoes, to find out the witch. Whereupon the
children cried out against the Indian woman as appearing to them and
tormenting them. Tituba said her mistress, in her own country, had
taught her how to find out a witch, but denied being one herself; but
afterwards (urged, as she subsequently declared, by her master) she
confessed; and the marks of Spanish cruelty on her body were assumed to
be the Devil&rsquo;s wounds. The Rev. Mr. Parris in a calmer time might
have vindicated poor Tituba by taking for text of his sermon on the
subject Christ&rsquo;s saying about a house divided against itself, and
reminding the colony, which held public fast against Satan, that the
devil was too clever to cover his Salem agent with wounds; but instead
of that he preached on the words, &lsquo;Have I not chosen you twelve,
and one of you is a devil.&rsquo; During <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb315" href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>this sermon a woman
left the church; she was sister of a woman who had also been accused by
the children, and, being offended by something Mr. Parris said, went
out of meeting; of course, also to prison. There were three other women
involved with Tituba, in whose fetish experiments a well-informed
writer thinks the Salem delusion began.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6138src" href="#xd26e6138" name="xd26e6138src">19</a> The
examination before the Deputy-Governor (Danforth) began at Salem, April
11, 1692, and there are several notable points in it. Tituba&rsquo;s
husband, the Indian John, cunningly escaped by pretending to be one of
the afflicted. He charged Goody Proctor, and said, &lsquo;She brought
the book to me.&rsquo; No one asked what book! Abigail Williams, also
one of the accusers of Goody, was asked, &lsquo;Does she bring the book
to you? <i>A.</i> Yes. <i>Q.</i> What would she have you do with it?
<i>A.</i> To write in it, and I shall be well.&rsquo; Not a descriptive
word is demanded or given concerning this book. The examiners are
evidently well acquainted with it. In the alleged confessions preserved
in official reports, but not in the words of the accused, the nature of
the book is made clear. Thus Mary Osgood &lsquo;confesses that about
eleven years ago, when she was in a melancholy state and condition, she
used to walk abroad in her orchard, and, upon a certain time she saw
the appearance of a cat at the end of the house, which yet she thought
was a real cat. However, at that time it diverted her from praying to
God, and instead thereof she prayed to the Devil; about which time she
made a covenant with the Devil, who, as a black man, came to her, and
presented her a book, upon which she laid her finger, and that left a
red spot. And that upon her signing that book, the devil told her that
he was her god.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href=
"#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span>This is not unlikely to be a
paraphrase of some sermon on the infernal Book of Satan corresponding
to the Book of Life, the theory being too conventional for the court to
inquire about the mysterious volume. Equally well known was the
Antichrist theory which had long represented that avatar of Satan as
having organised a church. Thus we read:&mdash;&lsquo;Abigail Williams,
did you see a company at Mr. Parris&rsquo;s house eat and drink?
<i>A.</i> Yes, sir; that was their sacrament. <i>Q.</i> What was it?
<i>A.</i> They said it was our blood.&rsquo; &lsquo;Mary Walcot, have
you seen a white man? <i>A.</i> Yes, sir, a great many times. <i>Q.</i>
What sort of man was he? <i>A.</i> A fine grave man, and when he came
he made all the witches to tremble.&rsquo; When it is remembered that
Mary Osgood had described the Devil as &lsquo;a black man&rsquo; (all
were thinking of the Indians), this Antiblackman suggests Christ
resisting Antichrist. Again, although nothing seems to have been said
in the court previously about baptism, one of the examiners asks
&lsquo;Goody Laccy how many years ago since they were baptized?
<i>A.</i> Three or four years ago I suppose. <i>Q.</i> Who baptized
them? <i>A.</i> The old serpent. <i>Q.</i> How did he do it? <i>A.</i>
He dipped their heads in the water, saying they were his, and that he
had power over them; &hellip; there were six (who) baptized. <i>Q.</i>
Name them. <i>A.</i> I think they were of the higher powers<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e6197" title="Not in source">.</span>&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are interspersed through the proceedings suggestions of mercy
on condition of confession, which, joined to these theoretical
questions, render it plain that the retractations which the so-called
witches made were true, and that in New England, at least, there was
little if any basis for the delusion beyond the experiment of the two
Spanish Indians. The terrible massacre of witches which occurred there
was the result of the decision of English judges and divines that
witchcraft <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>is recognised in the Bible, and there assigned
the death-penalty.</p>
<p>It will be observed here that ancient mythology to Salem is chiefly
that of the Bible, modified by local conditions. White man and black
man represent Christ and Antichrist, and we have the same symbols on
both sides,&mdash;eucharists, baptisms, and names written in books. The
survivals from European folklore met with in the New England trials
are&mdash;the cat, the horse (rarely), and the dog. In one case a dog
suffered from the repute of being a witch, insomuch that some who met
him fell into fits; he was put to death. Riding through the air
continues, but the American witches ride upon a stick or pole. The
old-fashioned broom, the cloud-symbol of the Wild Huntsman, is rarely
mentioned. One thing, however, survives from England, at least; the
same sharp controversy that is reflected in the Fairfax case. Cotton
Mather tried one of the possessed with the Bible, the
&lsquo;Assembly&rsquo;s Catechism,&rsquo; his grandfather&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Milk for Babes,&rsquo; his father&rsquo;s &lsquo;Remarkable
Providence,&rsquo; and a book to prove there were witches. &lsquo;And
when any of those were offered for her to read in, she would be struck
dead and fall into convulsions.&rsquo; But when he tried her with
Popish and Quaker books, the English Prayer-Book, and a book to prove
there were no witches, the devil permitted her to read these as long as
she pleased. One is at a loss which most to admire, the astuteness of
the accused witch in bearing testimony to the Puritan religion, or the
phenomenon of its eminent representative seeking a witness to it in the
Father of lies.</p>
<p>If now we travel towards the East we find the survivals growing
clearer, as in the West they become faint.</p>
<p>In 1669 the people of the villages of Mohra and Elfdale in Sweden,
believing that they were troubled by witches, were visited by a royal
commission, the result of whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318"
href="#pb318" name="pb318">318</a>]</span>investigations was the
execution of twenty-three adults and fifteen children; running of the
gauntlet by thirty-six between the ages of nine and sixteen years; the
lashing on the hand of twenty children for three Sundays at the
church-door, and <span class="corr" id="xd26e6212" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> lashing of the aforesaid thirty-six
once a week for a year. Portions of the confessions of the witches are
given below from the Public Register as translated by Anthony Horneck,
D.D., and printed in London, anno 1700. I add a few words in brackets
to point out survivals.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We of the province of Elfdale do confess that we used to go
to a gravel-pit which lay hard by a cross-way (Hecate), and there we
put on a vest (Wolf-girdle) over our heads, and then danced round, and
after this ran to the cross-way, and called the Devil thrice, first
with a still voice, the second time somewhat louder, and the third time
very loud, with these words&mdash;<i>Antecessor</i>, <i>come and carry
us to Blockula</i>. Whereupon immediately he used to appear, but in
different habits; but for the most part we saw him in a grey coat and
red and blue stockings: he had a red beard (Barbarossa), a high-crowned
hat (Turn-cap), with linen of divers colours wrapt about it, and long
garters upon his stockings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then he asked us whether we would serve him with soul and
body. If we were content to do so, he set us upon a beast which he had
there ready, and carried us over churches and high walls; and after all
we came to a green meadow where Blockula lies. We must procure some
scrapings of altars, and filings of church clocks; and then he gives us
a horn with a salve in it, wherewith we do anoint ourselves (chrism);
and a saddle with a hammer (Thor&rsquo;s), and a wooden nail, thereby
to fix the saddle (Walkyr&rsquo;s); whereupon we call upon the Devil
and away we go.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href=
"#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;For their journey, they said they made use of all sorts of
instruments, of beasts, of men, of spits, and posts, according as they
had opportunity: if they do ride upon goats (Azazel) and have many
children with them, that all may have room, they stick a spit into the
backside of the Goat, and then are anointed with the aforesaid
ointment. What the manner of their journey is, God only knows. Thus
much was made out, that if the children did at any time name the names
(Egyptian spells) of those that had carried them away, they were again
carried by force either to Blockula, or to the cross-way, and there
miserably beaten, insomuch that some of them died of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little girl of Elfdale confessed that, naming the name of
<span class="sc">Jesus</span> as she was carried away, she fell
suddenly upon the ground, and got a great hole in her side, which the
Devil presently healed up again, and away he carried her; and to this
day the girl confessed she had exceeding great pain in her
side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They unanimously confessed that Blockula is situated in a
delicate large meadow, whereof you can see no end. The place or house
they met at had before it a gate painted with divers colours; through
this gate they went into a little meadow distinct from the other, where
the beasts went that they used to ride on; but the men whom they made
use of in their journey stood in the house by the gate in a slumbering
posture, sleeping against the wall (castle of Waldemar). In a huge
large room of this house, they said, there stood a very long table, at
which the witches did sit down; and that hard by this room was another
chamber where there were very lovely and delicate beds. The first thing
they must do at Blockula was, that they must deny all, and devote
themselves body and soul to the Devil, and promise to serve him
faithfully, and confirm all this with an oath (initiation). Hereupon
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>cut their fingers (Odinism), and with their
blood write their name in his book (Revelations). They added that he
caused them to be baptized, too, by such priests as he had there
(Antichrist&rsquo;s Sacraments).&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And he, the Devil, bids them believe that the day of judgment
will come speedily, and therefore sets them on work to build a great
house of stone (Babel), promising that in that house he will preserve
them from God&rsquo;s fury, and cause them to enjoy the greatest
delights and pleasures (Moslem). But while they work exceeding hard at
it, there falls a great part of the wall down again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They said, they had seen sometimes a very great Devil like a
Dragon, with fire round about him, and bound with an iron chain
(Apocalyptic), and the Devil that converses with them tells them that
if they confess anything he will let that great Devil loose upon them,
whereby all Sweedeland shall come into great danger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They added that the Devil had a church there, such another as
in the town of Mohra. When the Commissioners were coming he told the
Witches they should not fear them; for he would certainly kill them
all. And they confessed that some of them had attempted to murther the
Commissioners, but had not been able to effect it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of the children talked much of a white Angel (Frigga as
christian tutelary), which used to forbid them what the Devil had bid
them do, and told them that those doings should not last long. What had
been done had been permitted because of the wickedness of the
people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those of Elfdale confessed that the Devil used to play upon
an harp before them (Tannhauser), and afterwards to go with them that
he liked best into a chamber, when he committed venerous acts with them
(Asmodeus); and this indeed all confessed, that he had carnal knowledge
of them, and that the Devil had sons and daughters <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>by
them, which he did marry together, and they &hellip; brought forth
toads and serpents (Echidna).</p>
<p>&lsquo;After this they sat down to table, and those that the Devil
esteemed most were placed nearest to him; but the children must stand
at the door, where he himself gives them meat and drink (Sacrament).
After meals they went to dancing, and in the meanwhile swore and cursed
most dreadfully, and afterwards went to fighting one with another
(Valhalla).</p>
<p>&lsquo;They also confessed that the Devil gives them a beast about
the bigness and shape of a young cat (Hecate), which they call a
carrier; and that he gives them a bird as big as a raven (Odin&rsquo;s
messenger), but white;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6254src" href=
"#xd26e6254" name="xd26e6254src">20</a> and these two creatures they
can send anywhere, and wherever they come they take away all sorts of
victuals they can get, butter, cheese, milk, bacon, and all sorts of
seeds, whatever they find, and carry it to the witch. What the bird
brings they may keep for themselves, but what the carrier brings they
must reserve for the Devil, and that is brought to Blockula, where he
doth give them of it so much as he thinks fit. They added likewise that
these carriers fill themselves so full sometimes, that they are forced
to spue (&lsquo;Odin&rsquo;s booty&rsquo;) by the way, which spuing is
found in several gardens, where colworts grow, and not far from the
houses of these witches. It is of a yellow colour like gold, and is
called butter of witches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Lords Commissioners were indeed very earnest, and took
great pains to persuade them to show some of their tricks, but to no
purpose; for they did all unanimously confess that since they had
confessed all, they found that all their witchcraft was gone, and that
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>Devil at this time appeared to them very
terrible, with claws on his hands and feet, and with horns on his head,
a long tail behind, and showed to them a pit burning, with a hand put
out; but the Devil did thrust the person down again with an iron fork;
and suggested to the witches that if they continued in their
confession, he would deal with them in the same manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ministers of both Elfdale and Mohra were the chief inciters of
this investigation, and both testified that they had suffered many
tortures in the night from the witches. One was taken by the throat and
so violently used that &lsquo;for some weeks he was not able to speak
or perform divine service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We have in this narrative the official and clerical statement, and
can never know to what the victims really confessed. Blockula seems to
be a Swedish edition of Blocksberg, of old considered a great resort of
witches. But we may especially note the epithet by which the witches
are said to have first appealed to the Devil&mdash;<i>Antecessor</i>.
Dr. Horneck has not given us the Swedish term of which this is a
translation, but we may feel assured that it was not a phrase coined by
the class among whom reputed witches were found. In all probability it
was a learned phrase of the time for some supposed power which preceded
and was conquered by Christianity; and if we knew its significance it
might supply a clue to the reality with which the Commissioners were
dealing. There would seem to be strong probabilities that in Sweden
also, as elsewhere, there had been a revival of faith in the old
religion whose barbaric rites had still survived in a few holes and
corners where they were practised by night. The Antecessor was still
present to hold out promises where the Successor had broken all that
his sponsors had made when the populace accepted his baptism. This
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>probability is further suggested by the fact
that some of these uncanny events happened at Elfdale, a name which
hints at a region of especial sanctity under the old religion, and also
by the statement that the Devil had a church there, a sort of travesty
of the village church. About the same time we find John Fiene
confessing in Scotland that the Devil appeared to him in &lsquo;white
raiment,&rsquo; and it is also testified that John heard &lsquo;the
Devil preach in a kirk in the pulpit in the night by candlelight, the
candle burning blue.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6270src" href=
"#xd26e6270" name="xd26e6270src">21</a></p>
<p>The names used by the Scotch witches are often suggestive of pagan
survivals. Thus in the trial at the Paisley Assizes, 1678, concerning
the alleged bewitching of Sir George Maxwell, <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6276" title="Source: Magaret">Margaret</span> Jackson testified
to giving up her soul by renouncing her baptism to a devil named Locas
(Loki?); another raised a tempest to impede the king&rsquo;s voyage to
Denmark by casting into the sea a cat, and crying Hola (Hela?); and
Agnes Sampson called the Devil to her in the shape of a dog by saying,
&lsquo;Elva (Elf?), come and speak to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is necessary to pass by many of the indications contained in the
witch-trials that there had been an effort to recur to the pleasures
and powers traditionally associated with the pagan era of Europe, and
confirmed by the very denunciations of contemporary paganism with its
pomp and luxury by the priesthood. The promises held out by the
&lsquo;Devil&rsquo; to Elfdale peasants and puritanised Helen Fairfax
are unmistakable. But it is necessary to remark also that the
ceremonies by which, as was clearly proved in various cases, the
fortune-tellers or &lsquo;witches&rsquo; endeavoured to imitate the
spells of Dr. Faustus were arch&aelig;ological.</p>
<p>Around the cauldron, which was used in imitation of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name="pb324">324</a>]</span>the
Alchemists, a rude Zodiac was marked, some alchemic signs being added;
and in the cauldron were placed ingredients concerning many of which
the accounts are confused. It is, however, certain that the chief
ingredients were plants which, precisely as in ancient Egypt, had been
gathered at certain phases of the moon, or seasons of the year, or from
some spot where the sun was supposed not to have shone on it. It was
clearly proved also that the plants chiefly used by the sorceresses
were rue and vervain. Vervain was sacred to the god of war in Greece
and Rome, and made the badge of ambassadors sent to make treaties of
peace. In Germany it was sacred to Thor, and he would not strike with
his lightning a house protected by it. The Druids called it &lsquo;holy
herb;&rsquo; they gathered it when the dog-star rose, from unsunned
spots, and compensated the earth for the deprivation with a sacrifice
of honey. Its reputation was sufficient in Ben Jonson&rsquo;s day for
him to write&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Bring your garlands, and with reverence place</p>
<p class="line">The vervain on the altar.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The charm which vervain had for the medi&aelig;val
peasant was that it was believed, if it had first touched a Bel-fire,
to snap iron; and, if boiled with rue, made a liquid which, being
poured on a gunflint, made the shot as sure to take effect as any
<span lang="de">Freisch&uuml;tz</span> could desire.</p>
<p>Rue was supposed to have a potent effect on the eye, and to bestow
second sight. So sacred was it once in England that missionaries
sprinkled holy water from brushes made up of it, whence it was called
&lsquo;herb of grace.&rsquo; Milton represents Michael as purging
Adam&rsquo;s eyes with it. In the Tyrol it is believed to confer fine
vision and used with agrimony (flowers of Argos, the many-eyed); in
Posen it is said also to heal serpent-bites. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>By
this route it came into the cauldron of the wizard and witch. In
Drayton&rsquo;s incantation it is said&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Then sprinkles she the juice of rue,</p>
<p class="line">With nine drops of the midnight dew</p>
<p class="line">From lunary distilling.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This association of lunary, or moon-wort, once
supposed to cure lunacy, with rue is in harmony with the mythology of
both. An old oracle, said to have been revealed by Hecate herself, ran
thus:&mdash;&lsquo;From a root of wild rue fashion and polish a statue;
adorn it with household lizards; grind myrrh, gum, and frankincense
with the same reptiles, and let the mixture stand in the air during the
waning of a moon; then address your vows in the following terms&rsquo;
(the formula is not preserved). &lsquo;As many forms as I have, so many
lizards let there be; do these things exactly; you will build me an
abode with branches of laurel, and having addressed fervent prayers to
the image, you will see me in your sleep.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6308src" href="#xd26e6308" name="xd26e6308src">22</a></p>
<p>Rue was thus consecrated as the very substance of Hecate, the mother
of all European witches. M. Maury supposes that it was because it was a
narcotic and caused hallucinations. Hallucinations were, no doubt, the
basis of belief in second sight. But whatever may be the cause, rue was
the plant of witchcraft; and Bishop Taylor speaks of its being used by
exorcists to try the devil, and thence deriving its appellation
&lsquo;herb of grace.&rsquo; More probably it was used to sprinkle holy
water because of a traditional <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326"
href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>sanctity. All narcotics were
supposed to be children of the night; and if, in addition, they were
able to cause hallucinations, they were supposed to be under more
especial care of the moon.</p>
<p>After reading a large number of reports concerning the ordeals and
trials of witches, and also many of their alleged confessions, I have
arrived at the conclusion that there were certainly gatherings held in
secret places; that some of the ordinary ceremonies and prayers of the
Church were used, with names of traditional deities and Oriental demons
substituted for those of the Trinity and saints; that with these were
mingled some observances which had been preserved from the ancient
world by Gnostics, Astrologists, and Alchemists. That at these
gatherings there was sometimes direct devil-worship is probable, but
oftener the invocations were in other names, and it is for the most
part due to the legal reporters that the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo; is so
often named. As to the &lsquo;confessions,&rsquo; many, no doubt,
admitted they had gone to witches&rsquo; Sabbaths who had been there
only in feverish dreams, as must have been the case of many young
children and morbid pietists who were executed; others confessed in
hope of escape from charges they could not answer; and others were
weary of their lives.</p>
<p>The writer of this well remembers, in a small Virginian village
(Falmouth), more than thirty years ago, the terrible persecutions to
which an old white woman named Nancy Calamese was subjected because of
her reputation as a witch. Rumours of lizards vomited by her poor
neighbours caused her to be dreaded by the ignorant; the negroes were
in terror of her; she hardly dared pass through the streets for fear of
being hooted by boys. One morning she waded into the Rappahannock river
and drowned herself, and many of her neighbours regarded the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>suicide as her confession. Probably it was a
similar sort of confession to many that we read in the reports of witch
trials.</p>
<p>The retribution that followed was more ferocious than could have
visited mere attempts by the poor and ignorant to call up spirits to
their aid. Every now and then the prosecutions disclose the well-known
animus of heresy, persecution, and also the fury of magistrates
suspicious of conspiracies. In England, New England, and France,
particularly, an incipient rationalism was revealed in the party called
&lsquo;Saducees,&rsquo; who tried to cast discredit on the belief in
witchcraft. This was recognised by Sir Mathew Hale in England and
Cotton Mather in New England, consequently by the chief authorities of
church and state in both countries, as an attack on biblical
infallibility, since it was said in the Bible, &lsquo;Thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live.&rsquo; The leading wizards and witches were
probably also persons who had been known in connection with the popular
discontent and revolutionary feeling displayed in so many of the
vindictive conjurations which were brought to light.</p>
<p>The horrors which attended the crushing out of this last revival of
paganism are such as recall the Bartholomew massacre and the recent
slaughter of Communists in Paris, so vividly that one can hardly
repress the suspicion that the same sort of mingled panic and
fanaticism were represented in them all. Dr. R&eacute;ville has summed
up the fearful history of three hundred years as
follows:&mdash;&lsquo;In the single year 1485, and in the district of
Worms alone, eighty-five witches were delivered to the flames. At
Geneva, at Basle, at Hamburg, at Ratisbon, at Vienna, and in a
multitude of other towns, there were executions of the same kind. At
Hamburg, among other victims, a physician was burnt alive, because he
saved the life of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328"
name="pb328">328</a>]</span>woman who had been given up by the midwife.
In Italy, during the year 1523, there were burnt in the diocese of Como
alone more than two hundred witches. This was after the new bull hurled
at witchcraft by Pope Adrian VI. In Spain it was still worse; there, in
1527, two little girls, of from nine to eleven years of age, denounced
a host of witches, whom they pretended to detect by a mark in their
left eye. In England and Scotland political influence was brought to
bear upon sorcery; Mary Stuart was animated by a lively zeal against
witches. In France the Parliament of Paris happily removed business of
this kind from the ecclesiastical tribunals; and under Louis XI.,
Charles VIII., and Louis XII. there were but few condemnations for the
practice of magic; but from the time of Francis I., and especially from
Henry II., the scourge reappeared. Jean Bodin, a man of sterling worth
in other respects, but stark mad upon the question of witchcraft,
communicated his mania to all classes of the nation. His contemporary
and disciple, Boguet, showed how that France swarmed with witches and
wizards. &lsquo;They increase and multiply on the land,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;even as do the caterpillars in our gardens. Would that they were
all got together in a heap, so that a single fire might burn them all
at once.&rsquo; Savoy, Flanders, the Jura Mountains, Lorraine,
B&eacute;arn, Provence, and in almost all parts of France, the
frightful hecatombs were seen ablaze. In the seventeenth century the
witch-fever somewhat abated, though it burst out here and there,
centralising itself chiefly in the convents of hysterical nuns. The
terrible histories of the priests Gaufridy and Urban Grandier are well
known. In Germany, and particularly in its southern parts,
witch-burning was still more frequent. In one small principality at
least 242 persons were burnt between 1646 and 1651; and, <i lang=
"la">horribile dictu</i>, in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href=
"#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>the official records of these
executions, we find that among those who suffered were children from
one to six years of age! In 1657 the witch-judge, Nicholas Remy,
boasted of having burnt 900 persons in fifteen years. It would even
seem that it is to the proceedings against sorcery that Germany owes
the introduction of torture as an ordinary mode of getting at the
truth. Mr. Roskoff reproduces a catalogue of the executions of witches
and wizards in the episcopal town of W&uuml;rzburg, in Bavaria, up to
the year 1629. In 1659 the number of those put to death for witchcraft
amounted, in this diocese, to 900. In the neighbouring bishopric of
Bamberg at least 600 were burnt. He enumerates thirty-one executions in
all, not counting some regarded by the compilers of the catalogue as
not important enough to mention. The number of victims at each
execution varies from two to seven. Many are distinguished by such
surnames as &lsquo;The Big Hunchback, The Sweetheart, The
Bridge-keeper, The Old Pork-woman,&rsquo; &amp;c. Among them appear
people of all sorts and conditions, actors, workmen, jugglers, town and
village maidens, rich burghers, nobles, students, magistrates even, and
a fair number of priests. Many are simply entered as &lsquo;a
foreigner.&rsquo; Here and there is added to the name of the condemned
person his age and a short notice. Among the victims, for instance, of
the twentieth execution figures &lsquo;Little Barbara, the prettiest
girl in W&uuml;rzburg;&rsquo; &lsquo;a student who could speak all
manner of languages, who was an excellent musician, <i lang=
"fr">vocaliter et instrumentaliter</i>;&rsquo; &lsquo;the master of the
hospice, a very learned man.&rsquo; We find, too, in this, gloomy
account the cruel record of children burnt for witchcraft; here a
little girl of about nine or ten years of age, with her baby sister,
younger than herself (their mother was burnt a little while
afterwards); here boys of ten or eleven; again, a young <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>girl
of fifteen; two children from the poorhouse; the little boy of a
councillor. The pen falls from one&rsquo;s hand in recapitulating such
monstrosities. Cannot those who would endow Catholicity with the dogma
of papal infallibility hearken, before giving their vote, to the cries
that rise before God, and which history re-echoes, of those poor
innocent ones whom pontifical bulls threw into flames? The seventeenth
century saw the rapid diminution of trials and tortures. In one of his
good moments, Louis XIV. mitigated greatly the severity of this special
legislation. For this he had to undergo the remonstrances of the
Parliament of Rouen, which believed society would be ruined if those
who dealt in sorcery were merely condemned to perpetual confinement.
The truth is, that belief in witchcraft was so wide-spread, that from
time to time even throughout the seventeenth century there were
isolated executions. One of the latest and most notorious was that of
Renata Saenger, superior of the convent of Unterzell, near
W&uuml;rzburg (1748). At Landshut, in Bavaria, in 1756, a young girl of
thirteen years was convicted of impure intercourse with the Devil, and
put to death. Seville in 1781, and Glaris in 1783, saw the last two
known victims to this fatal superstition.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6339src" href="#xd26e6339" name="xd26e6339src">23</a></p>
<p>The Reformation swept away in Northern countries, for the upper
classes, as many Christian saints and angels as priestcraft had
previously turned to enemies for the lower. The poor and ignorant
simply tried to evoke the same ideal spirit-guardians under the pagan
forms legendarily associated with a golden age. Witchcraft was a
pathetic appeal against a cruel present to a fair, however visionary,
past. But Protestantism has brought on famine of another
kind&mdash;famine of the heart. The saints of the Church have followed
those of paganism; and although one result of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>the
process has been a vast increase in enterprise, science, and wealth,
man cannot live by these alone. Modern spiritualism, which so many
treat with a superciliousness little creditable to a scientific age, is
a cry of starved sentiment and affections left hopeless under faded
heavens, as full of pathetic meaning as that which was wrung from serfs
enticed into temples only to find them dens of thieves. Desolate hearts
take up the burthen of desolate homes, and appeal to invisible powers
for guidance; and for attestation of hopes which science has blighted,
ere poetry, art, and philanthropy have changed these ashes into beauty.
Because these so-called spirits, evoked by mediums out of morbid
nerves, are really longed-for ideals, the darker features of witchcraft
are not called about them. That fearful movement was a wronged Medea
whose sorrows had made Hecate&mdash;to remember the dreadful phrase of
Euripides&mdash;&lsquo;the chosen assistant dwelling in the inmost
recesses of her house.&rsquo; Modern spiritualism is Rachel weeping for
her children, not to be comforted if they are not. But the madness of
the one is to be understood by the plaintive appeal of the other.

<p class="first">The name Mephistopheles has in it, I think, the
priest&rsquo;s shudder at the fumes of the laboratory. Duntzer<a class=

finds that the original form of the word was
&lsquo;Mephostophiles,&rsquo; and conjectures that it was a bungling
effort to put together three Greek words, to mean &lsquo;not loving the
light.&rsquo; In this he has the support of Bayard Taylor, who also
thinks that it was so understood by Goethe. The transformation of it
was probably amid the dreaded gases with which the primitive chemist
surrounded himself. He who began by &lsquo;not loving the light&rsquo;
became the familiar of men seeking light, and lover of their mephitic
gases. The ancient Romans had a mysterious divinity called Mephitis,
whose grove and temple were in the Esquili&aelig;, near a place it was
thought fatal to enter. She is thought to have been invoked against the
mephitic exhalations of the earth in the grove of Albunea. Sulphur
springs also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333</a>]</span>were of old regarded as ebullitions from hell,
and both Schwarz and Roger Bacon particularly dealt in that kind of
smell. Considering how largely Asmodeus, as &lsquo;fine
gentleman,&rsquo; entered into the composition of Mephistopheles, and
how he flew from Nineveh to Egypt (Tobit) to avoid a bad smell, it
seems the irony of mythology that he should turn up in Europe as a
mephitic spirit.</p>
<p>Mephistopheles is the embodiment of all that has been said in
preceding chapters of the ascetic&rsquo;s horror of nature and the
pride of life, and of the medi&aelig;val priest&rsquo;s curse on all
learning he could not monopolise. The Faust myth is merely his shadow
cast on the earth, the tracery of his terrible power as the Church
would have the people dread it. The early Raven Book at Dresden has the
title:&mdash;&lsquo; <span lang="de">&dagger; &dagger; &dagger; D. J.

purporting to be a proclamation signed by the said Pope and Cardinal
Piccolomini concerning the secrets which the celebrated Dr. Faust had
scattered throughout Germany, commanding <i lang="la">ut ad Arcanum

<p>This is an impudent forgery, but it is an invention which, more than
anything actually issued from Rome, indicates the popular understanding
that the contention of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href=
"#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>the Church was not against the
validity of magic arts, but against their exercise by persons not
authorised by itself. It was, indeed, a tradition not combated by the
priests, that various ecclesiastics had possessed such powers, even
Popes, as John XXII., Gregory VII., and Clement V. The first Sylvester
was said to have a dragon at his command; John XXII. denounced his
physicians and courtiers for necromancy; and the whispers connecting
the Vatican with sorcery lasted long enough to attribute to the late
Pius IX. a power of the evil eye. Such awful potencies the Church
wished to be ascribed to itself alone. Faust is a legend invented to
impress on the popular mind the fate of all who sought knowledge in
unauthorised ways and for non-ecclesiastical ends.</p>
<p>In the Raven Book just mentioned, there are provisions for calling
up spirits which, in their blending of christian with pagan formulas,
oddly resemble the solemn proceedings sometimes affected by our
spiritual mediums. The magician (<i>Magister</i>) had best be alone,
but if others are present, their number must be odd; he should
deliberate beforehand what business he wishes to transact with the
spirits; he must observe God&rsquo;s commandment; trust the
Almighty&rsquo;s help; continue his conjuration, though the spirits do
not appear quickly, with unwavering faith; mark a circle on parchment
with a dove&rsquo;s blood; within this circle write in Latin the names
of the four quarters of heaven; write around it the Hebrew letters of
God&rsquo;s name, and beneath it write <i>Sadan</i>; and standing in
this circle he must repeat the ninety-first Psalm. In addition there
are seals in red and black, various Hebrew, Greek, and Latin words,
chiefly such as contain the letters Q, W, X, Y, Z,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
Yschyros, Theos, Zebaoth, Adonay. The specimen (<a href="#fig22">Fig.
22</a>), which I copied from the book in Dresden, is there called
&lsquo;Sigillum Telschunhab.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Black Raven&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>is pictured in the book, and explained as the
form in which the angel Raphael taught Tobias to summon spirits. It is
said also that the Magician must in certain cases write with blood of a
fish (Tobit again) or bat on &lsquo;maiden-parchment,&rsquo;&mdash;this
being explained as the skin of a goat, but unpleasantly suggestive of a
different origin.</p>

<p>In this book, poorly printed, and apparently on a private press,
Mephistopheles is mentioned as one of the chief Princes of Hell. He is
described as a youth, adept in all arts and services, who brings
spirit-servants or familiars, and brings treasures from earth and sea
with speed. In the Frankfort Faust Book (1587), Mephistopheles says,
&lsquo;I am a spirit, and a flying spirit, potently ruling under the
heavens.&rsquo; In the oldest legends he appears as a dog, that, as we
have seen, being the normal form of tutelary divinities, the symbol of
the Scribe in Egypt, guard of Hades, and psychopomp of various
mythologies. A dog appears following the family of Tobias. Manlius
reports Melancthon as saying, &lsquo;He (Faust) had a dog with him,
which was the Devil.&rsquo; Johann Gast (&lsquo;<span lang=
"la">Sermones Conviviales</span>&rsquo;) says he was present at a
dinner at Basle given by Faust, and adds: &lsquo;He had also a dog and
a horse with him, both of which, I believe, were devils, for they were
able to do everything. Some persons told me that the dog frequently
took the shape of a servant, and brought him food.&rsquo; In the old
legends this dog is named <i>Praestigiar</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6425src" href="#xd26e6425" name="xd26e6425src">2</a></p>
<p>As for the man Faust, he seems to have been personally the very
figure which the Church required, and had the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name=
"pb336">336</a>]</span>friar, in whose guise Mephistopheles appears,
been his actual familiar, he could hardly have done more to bring
learning into disgrace. Born at the latter part of the fifteenth
century at Knittlingen, Wurtemberg, of poor parents, the bequest of an
uncle enabled him to study medicine at Cracow University, and it seems
plain that he devoted his learning and abilities to the work of
deluding the public. That he made money by his
&lsquo;mediumship,&rsquo; one can only infer from the activity with
which he went about Germany and advertised his &lsquo;powers.&rsquo; It
was at a time when high prices were paid for charms, philtres, mandrake
mannikins; and the witchcraft excitement was not yet advanced enough to
render dealing in such things perilous. It seems that the Catholic
clergy made haste to use this impostor to point their moral against
learning, and to identify him as first-fruit of the Reformation; while
the Reformers, with equal zeal, hurled him back upon the papists as
outcome of their idolatries. Melancthon calls him &lsquo;an abominable
beast, a sewer of many devils.&rsquo; The first mention of him is by
Trithemius in a letter of August 20, 1507, who speaks of him as
&lsquo;a pretender to magic&rsquo; (&lsquo;Magister Georgius
Sabellicus, Faustus Junior&rsquo;), whom he met at Gelnhaussen; and in
another letter of the same year as at Kreuznach, Conrad Mudt, friend of
Luther and Melancthon, mentions (Oct. 3, 1513) the visit to Erfurth of
Georgius Faustus Hemitheus Hedebeyensis, &lsquo;a braggart and a fool
who affects magic,&rsquo; whom he had &lsquo;heard talking in a
tavern,&rsquo; and who had &lsquo;raised theologians against
him.&rsquo; In Vogel&rsquo;s Annals of Leipzig (1714), kept in
Auerbach&rsquo;s Cellar, is recorded under date 1525 Dr. Johann
Faust&rsquo;s visit to the Cellar. He appears therefore to have already
had <i>aliases</i>. The first clear account of him is in the
&lsquo;<span lang="la">Index Sanitatis</span>&rsquo; of Dr. Philip
Begardi (1539), who says: &lsquo;Since several years he has gone
through all regions, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337"
name="pb337">337</a>]</span>provinces, and kingdoms, made his name
known to everybody, and is highly renowned for his great skill, not
alone in medicine, but also in chiromancy, necromancy, physiognomy,
visions in crystal, and the like other arts. And also not only
renowned, but written down and known as an experienced master. Himself
admitted, nor denied that it was so, and that his name was Faustus, and
called himself <i lang="la">philosophum philosophorum</i>. But how many
have complained to me that they were deceived by him&mdash;verily a
great number! But what matter?&mdash;<i lang="de">hin ist
hin</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These latter words may mean that Faust had just died. He must have
died about that time, and with little notice. The rapidity with which a
mythology began to grow around him is worthy of more attention than the
subject has received. In 1543 the protestant theologian Johann Gast has
(&lsquo;<span lang="la">Sermones Convivialium</span>&rsquo;) stories of
his diabolical dog and horse, and of the Devil&rsquo;s taking him off,
when his body turns itself five times face downward. In 1587 Philip
Camerarius speaks of him as &lsquo;a well-known <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6452" title="Source: magican">magician</span> who lived in the
time of our fathers.&rsquo; April 18, 1587, two students of the
University of T&uuml;bingen were imprisoned for writing a Comedy of Dr.
Faustus: though it was not permitted to make light of the story, it was
thought a very proper one to utilise for pious purposes, and in the
autumn of the same year (1587) the original form of the legend was
published by Spiess in Frankfort. It describes Faust as summoning the
Devil at night, in a forest near Wittenberg. The evil spirit visits him
on three occasions in his study, where on the third he gives his name
as &lsquo;Mephostophiles,&rsquo; and the compact to serve him for
twenty-four years for his soul is signed. When Faust pierces his hand,
the blood flows into the form of the words <i>O homo fuge!</i>
Mephistopheles first serves him as a monk, and brings him fine
garments, wine, and food. Many of the luxuries are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>brought from the mansions of prelates, which
shows the protestant bias of the book; which is also shown in the
objection the Devil makes to Faust&rsquo;s marrying, because marriage
is pleasing to God. Mephistopheles changes himself to a winged horse,
on which Faust is borne through many countries, arriving at last at
Rome. Faust passes three days, invisible, in the Vatican, which
supplies the author with another opportunity to display papal luxury,
as well as the impotence of the Pope and his cardinals to exorcise the
evil powers which take their food and goblets when they are about to
feast. On his further aerial voyages Faust gets a glimpse of the garden
of Eden; lives in state in the Sultan&rsquo;s palace in the form of
Mohammed; and at length becomes a favourite in the Court of Charles V.
at Innsbruck. Here he evokes Alexander the Great and his wife. In
roaming about Germany, Faust diverts himself by swallowing a load of
hay and horses, cutting off heads and replacing them, making flowers
bloom at Christmas, drawing wine from a table, and calling Helen of
Troy to appear to some students. Helen becomes his mistress; by her he
has a son, Justus Faustus; but these disappear simultaneously with the
dreadful end of Dr. Faustus, who after a midnight storm is found only
in the fragments with which his room is strewn.</p>
<p>Several of these legends are modifications of those current before
Faust&rsquo;s time. The book had such an immense success that new
volumes and versions on the same subject appeared not only in Germany
but in other parts of Europe,&mdash;a rhymed version in England, 1588;
a translation from the German in France, 1589; a Dutch translation,
1592; Christopher Marlowe&rsquo;s drama in 1604.</p>
<p>In Marlowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tragical History of Doctor Faustus,&rsquo;
the mass of legends of occult arts that had crystallised around
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name=
"pb339">339</a>]</span>a man thoroughly representative of them was
treated with the dignity due to a subject amid whose moral and historic
grandeur Faust is no longer the petty personality he really was. He is
precisely the character which the Church had been creating for a
thousand years, only suddenly changed from other-worldly to worldly
desires and aims. What he seeks is what all the energy of civilisation
seeks.</p>

<p class="first">So, dying away amid the thunders of the Reformation,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340" name=
"pb340">340</a>]</span>were heard the echoes of the early christian
voices which exulted in the eternal tortures of the Greek poets and
philosophers: the anathemas on Roger Bacon, Socinus, Galileo; the
outcries with which every great invention has been met. We need only
retouch the above extracts here and there to make Faust&rsquo;s
aspirations those of a saint. Let the gold be sought in New Jerusalem,
the pearl in its gates, the fruits in paradise, the philosophy that of
Athanasius, and no amount of selfish hunger and thirst for them would
grieve any &lsquo;Good Angel&rsquo; he had ever heard of.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Good Angel&rsquo; has not yet gained his wings who will
tell him that all he seeks is included in the task of humanity, but
warn him that the method by which he would gain it is just that by
which he has been instructed to seek gold and jasper of the New
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6537" title=
"Source: Jerusalen">Jerusalem</span>,&mdash;not by fulfilling the
conditions of them, but as the object of some favouritism. Every human
being who ever sought to obtain benefit by prayers or praises that
might win the good graces of a supposed bestower of benefits, instead
of by working for them, is but the Faust of his side&mdash;be it
supernal or infernal. Hocus-pocus and invocation, blood-compacts and
sacraments,&mdash;they are all the same in origin; they are all mean
attempts to obtain advantages beyond other people without serving up to
them or deserving them. To Beelzebub Faust will &lsquo;build an altar
and a church;&rsquo; but he had probably never entered a church or
knelt before an altar with any less selfishness.</p>
<p>A strong Nemesis follows Self to see that its bounds are not
overpassed without retribution. Its satisfactions must be weighed in
the balance with its renunciations. And the inflexible law applies to
intellect and self-culture as much as to any other power of man.
Mephistopheles is &lsquo;the kernel of the brute;&rsquo; he is the
intellect with mere canine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href=
"#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>hunger for knowledge because of
the power it brings. Or, falling on another part of human nature, it is
pride making itself abject for ostentation; or it is passion selling
love for lust. <i>Re-enter Mephistopheles with Devils, who give crowns
and rich apparel to Faustus, dance, and then depart.</i> To the man who
has received his intellectual and moral liberty only to so spend it,
Lucifer may well say, in Marlowe&rsquo;s words&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Christ cannot save thy soul, for he is just:</p>
<p class="line">There&rsquo;s none but I have interest in the same.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Perhaps he might even better have suggested to Faust
that his soul was not of sufficient significance to warrant much
anxiety.</p>
<p>Something was gained when it was brought before the people in
popular dramas of Faust how little the Devil cared for the cross which
had so long been regarded as the all-sufficient weapon against
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6557src" href="#xd26e6557" name=
"xd26e6557src">3</a> Faust and Mephistopheles flourish in the Vatican
despite all the crosses raised to exorcise them. The confession of the
cross which once meant martyrdom of the confessor had now come to mean
martyrdom of the denier. Protestantism put its faith in Theology,
Creeds, and Orthodoxy. But Calderon de la Barca blended the legend of
Faust with the legendary temptation of St. Cyprian, and in &lsquo;El
Magico Prodigioso&rsquo; we have, in impressive contrast, the
powerlessness of the evil powers over the heart of a pure woman, and
its easy entrance into a mind fully furnished with the soundest
sentiments of theology. St. Cyprian had been a worshipper of pagan
deities<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6560src" href="#xd26e6560" name=
"xd26e6560src">4</a> before his conversion, and even after this he had
once saved himself while other christians <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>were suffering
martyrdom. It is possible that out of this may have grown the legend of
his having called his earlier deities&mdash;theoretically changed to
devils&mdash;to his aid; a trace of the legend being that magical
&lsquo;Book of Cyprianus&rsquo; mentioned in another chapter. In his
tract &lsquo;<span lang="la">De Gratia Dei</span>&rsquo; Cyprian says
concerning his spiritual condition before conversion, &lsquo;I lay in
darkness, and floating on the world&rsquo;s boisterous sea, with no
resting-place for my feet, ignorant of my proper life, and estranged
from truth and light.&rsquo; Here is a metaphorical &lsquo;vasty
deep&rsquo; from which the centuries could hardly fail to conjure up
spirits, one of them being the devil of Calderon&rsquo;s drama, who
from a wrecked ship walks Christ-like over the boisterous sea to find
Cyprian on the sea-shore. The drama opens with a scene which recalls
the most perilous of St. Anthony&rsquo;s temptations. According to
Athanasius, the Devil having utterly failed to conquer Anthony&rsquo;s
virtue by charming images, came to him in his proper black and ugly
shape, and, candidly confessing that he was the Devil, said he had been
vanquished by the saint&rsquo;s extraordinary sanctity. Anthony
prevailed against the spirit of pride thus awakened; but
Calderon&rsquo;s Cyprian, though he does not similarly recognise the
Devil, becomes complacent at the dialectical victory which the tempter
concedes him. Cyprian having argued the existence and supremacy of God,
the Devil says, &lsquo;How can I impugn so clear a consequence?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Do you regret my victory?&rsquo; &lsquo;Who but regrets a check
in rivalry of wit?&rsquo; He leaves, and Cyprian says, &lsquo;I never
met a more learned person.&rsquo; The Devil is equally satisfied,
knowing, no doubt, that gods worked out by the wits alone remain in
their abode of abstraction and do not interfere with the world of
sense. Calderon is artful enough to throw the trial of Cyprian back
into his pagan period, but the mirror is no less true in reflecting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>for those who had eyes to see in it the weakness
of theology.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enter the Devil as a fine gentleman,&rsquo; is the first sign
of the temptation in Calderon&rsquo;s drama&mdash;it is
Asmodeus<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6572src" href="#xd26e6572" name=
"xd26e6572src">5</a> again, and the &lsquo;pride of life&rsquo; he
first brings is the conceit of a clever theological victory. So
sufficient is the doorway so made for all other pride to enter, that
next time the devil needs no disguise, but has only to offer him a
painless victory over nature and the world, including Justina, the
object of his passion.</p>

to perform his exact engagements, and consequently does <span class=

win in the game. He enables Cyprian to move mountains and conquer
beasts, until he boasts that he can excel his infernal teacher, but the
Devil cannot bring Justina. She has told Cyprian that she will love him
in death. Cyprian and she together abjure their paganism at Antioch,
and meet in a cell just before their martyrdom. Over their bodies lying
dead on the scaffold the Devil appears as a winged serpent, and says he
is compelled to announce that they have both ascended to heaven. He
descends into the earth.</p>
<p>What the story of Faust and Mephistopheles had become in the popular
mind of Germany, when Goethe was raising it to be an immortal type of
the conditions under which genius and art can alone fulfil their task,
is well shown in the sensational tragedy written by his contemporary,
the playwright Klinger. The following extract from Klinger&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Faust&rsquo; is not without a certain impressiveness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Night covered the earth with its raven wing. Faust stood
before the awful spectacle of the body of his son suspended upon the
gallows. Madness parched his brain, and he exclaimed in the wild tones
of dispair:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Satan, let me but bury this unfortunate being, and then you
may take this life of mine, and I will descend into your infernal
abode, where I shall no more behold men in the flesh. I have learned to
know them, and I am disgusted with them, with their destiny, with the
world, and with life. My good action has drawn down unutterable woe
upon my head; I hope that my evil ones may have been productive of
good. Thus should it be in the mad confusion of earth. Take me hence; I
wish to become an inhabitant of thy dreary abode; I am tired of light,
compared with which the darkness in the infernal regions must be the
brightness of mid-day.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345"
href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span></p>
<p>But Satan replied: &lsquo;Hold! not so fast&mdash;Faust; once I told
thee that thou alone shouldst be the arbiter of thy life, that thou
alone shouldst have power to break the hour-glass of thy existence;
thou hast done so, and the hour of my vengeance has come, the hour for
which I have sighed so long. Here now do I tear from thee thy mighty
wizard-wand, and chain thee within the narrow bounds which I draw
around thee. Here shalt thou stand and listen to me, and tremble; I
will draw forth the terrors of the dark past, and kill thee with slow
despair.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus will I exult over thee, and rejoice in my victory. Fool!
thou hast said that thou hast learned to know man! Where? How and when?
Hast thou ever considered his nature? Hast thou ever examined it, and
separated from it its foreign elements? Hast thou distinguished between
that which is offspring of the pure impulses of his heart, and that
which flows from an imagination corrupted by art? Hast thou compared
the wants and the vices of his nature with those which he owes to
society and prevailing corruption? Hast thou observed him in his
natural state, where each of his undisguised expressions mirrors forth
his inmost soul? No&mdash;thou hast looked upon the mask that society
wears, and hast mistaken it for the true lineaments of man; thou hast
only become acquainted with men who have consecrated their condition,
wealth, power, and talents to the service of corruption; who have
sacrificed their pure nature to your Idol&mdash;Illusion. Thou didst at
one time presume to show me the moral worth of man! and how didst thou
set about it! By leading me upon the broad highways of vice, by
bringing me to the courts of the mighty wholesale butchers of men, to
that of the coward tyrant of France, of the Usurper in England! Why did
we pass by the mansions of the good and the just? Was it for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>me, Satan, to whom thou hast chosen to become a
mentor, to point them out to thee? No; thou wert led to the places thou
didst haunt by the fame of princes, by thy pride, by thy longing after
dissipation. And what hast thou seen there? The soul-seared tyrants of
mankind, with their satellites, wicked women and mercenary priests, who
make religion a tool by which to gain the object of their base
passions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hast thou ever deigned to cast a glance at the oppressed,
who, sighing under his burden, consoles himself with the hope of an
hereafter? Hast thou ever sought for the dwelling of the virtuous
friend of humanity, for that of the noble sage, for that of the active
and upright father of a family?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how would that have been possible? How couldst thou, the
most corrupt of thy race, have discovered the pure one, since thou
hadst not even the capacity to suspect his existence?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Proudly didst thou pass by the cottages of the pure and
humble, who live unacquainted with even the names of your artificial
vices, who earn their bread in the sweat of their brow, and who rejoice
at their last hour that they are permitted to exchange the mortal for
the immortal. It is true, hadst thou entered their abode, thou mightst
not have found thy foolish ideal of an heroic, extravagant virtue,
which is only the fanciful creation of your vices and your pride; but
thou wouldst have seen the man of a retiring modesty and noble
resignation, who in his obscurity excels in virtue and true grandeur of
soul your boasted heroes of field and cabinet. Thou sayest that thou
knowest man! Dost thou know thyself? Nay, deeper yet will I enter into
the secret places of thy heart, and fan with fierce blast the flames
which thou hast kindled there for thee. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>&lsquo;Had I a thousand human tongues, and as many years to speak to
thee, they would be all insufficient to develop the consequences of thy
deeds and thy recklessness. The germ of wretchedness which thou hast
sown will continue its growth through centuries yet to come; and future
generations will curse thee as the author of their misery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Behold, then, daring and reckless man, the importance of
actions that appear circumscribed to your mole vision! Who of you can
say, Time will obliterate the trace of my existence! Thou who knowest
not what beginning, what middle, and end are, hast dared to seize with
a bold hand the chain of fate, and hast attempted to gnaw its links,
notwithstanding that they were forged for eternity!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But now will I withdraw the veil from before thy eyes, and
then&mdash;cast the spectre despair into thy soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faust pressed his hands upon his face; the worm that never
dieth gnawed already on his heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The essence and sum of every devil are in the Mephistopheles of

<p>He knows, too, that the existing moment alone is of any advantage;
that theory is grey and life ever green; that he only gathers real
fruit who confides in himself. He is thus the perfectly evolved
intellect of man, fully in possession of all its implements, these
polished till they shine in all grace, subtlety, adequacy. Nature shows
no symbol of such power more complete than the gemmed serpent with its
exquisite adaptations,&mdash;freed from cumbersome prosaic feet, equal
to the winged by its flexible spine, every tooth artistic.</p>
<p>From an ancient prison was this Ariel liberated by his Prospero,
whose wand was the Reformation, a spirit finely touched to fine issues.
But his wings cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. The ancient heaven has
faded before the clearer eye, but the starry ideals have come nearer.
The old hells have burnt out, but the animalism of man couches all the
more freely on his path, having broken every chain of fear. Man still
walks between the good and evil, on the hair-drawn bridge of his moral
nature. His faculties seem adapted with equal precision to either side
of his life, upper or under,&mdash;to Wisdom or Cunning, Self-respect
or Self-conceit, Prudence or Selfishness, Lust or Love.</p>
<p>Such is the seeming situation, but is it the reality? Goethe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Faust&rsquo; is the one clear answer which this question has
received.</p>
<p>In one sense Mephistopheles may be called a German devil. The
Christian soul of Germany was from the first a changeling. The ancient
Nature-worship of that race might have had its normal development in
the sciences, and alone with this intellectual evolution there must
have been formed a related religion able to preserve social order
through the honour of man. But the native soul of Germany was cut out
by the sword and replaced with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349"
href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>a mongrel Hebrew-Latin soul.
The metaphorical terrors of tropical countries,&mdash;the deadly worms,
the burning and suffocating blasts and stenches, with which the mind of
those dwelling near them could familiarise itself when met with in
their scriptures, acquired exaggerated horrors when left to be pictured
by the terrorised imagination of races ignorant of their origin. It is
a long distance from Potsdam and Hyde Park to Zahara. Christianity
therefore blighted nature in the north by apparitions more fearful than
the southern world ever knew, and long after the pious there could sing
and dance, puritanical glooms hung over the Christians of higher
latitudes. When the progress of German culture began the work of
dissipating these idle terrors, the severity of the reaction was
proportioned to the intensity of the delusions. The long-famished
faculties rushed almost madly into their beautiful world, but without
the old reverence which had once knelt before its phenomena. That may
remain with a few, but the cynicism of the noisiest will be reflected
even upon the faces of the best. Goethe first had his attention drawn
to Spinoza by a portrait of him on a tract, in which his really noble
countenance was represented with a diabolical aspect. The orthodox had
made it, but they could only have done so by the careers of Faust,
Paracelsus, and their tribe. These too helped to conventionalise
Voltaire into a Mephistopheles.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6689src"
href="#xd26e6689" name="xd26e6689src">8</a></p>
<p>Goethe was probably the first European man to carry out this
scepticism to its full results. He was the first who recognised that
the moral edifice based upon monastic theories must follow them; and he
had in his own life already questioned the right of the so-called
morality to its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350"
name="pb350">350</a>]</span>supreme if not tyrannous authority over
man. Hereditary conscience, passing through this fierce crucible, lay
levigable before Goethe, to be swept away into dust-hole or moulded
into the image of reason. There remained around the animal nature of a
free man only a thread which seemed as fine as that which held the
monster Fenris. It was made only of the sentiment of love and that of
honour. But as Fenris found the soft invisible thread stronger than
chains, Faust proved the tremendous sanctions that surround the finer
instincts of man.</p>
<p>Emancipated from grey theory, Faust rushes hungrily at the golden
fruit of life. The starved passions will have their satisfaction, at
whatever cost to poor Gretchen. The fruit turns to ashes on his lips.
The pleasure is not that of the thinking man, but of the accomplished
poodle he has taken for his guide. To no moment in that intrigue can
the suffrage of his whole nature say, &lsquo;Stay, thou art
fair!&rsquo; That is the pact&mdash;it is the distinctive keynote of
Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faust.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Canst thou by falsehood or by flattery</p>
<p class="line">Make me one moment with myself at peace,</p>
<p class="line">Cheat me into tranquillity?&mdash;come then</p>
<p class="line">And welcome life&rsquo;s last day.</p>
<p class="line">Make me to the passing moment plead.</p>
<p class="line">Fly not, O stay, thou art so fair!</p>
<p class="line">Then will I gladly perish.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The pomp and power of the court, luxury and wealth,
equally fail to make the scholar at peace with himself. They are
symbolised in the paper money by which Mephistopheles replenished the
imperial exchequer. The only allusion to the printing-press, whose
inventor Fust had been somewhat associated with Faust, is to show its
power turned to the work of distributing irredeemable promises.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span></p>
<p>At length one demand made by Faust makes Mephistopheles tremble. As
a mere court amusement he would have him raise Helen of Troy. Reluctant
that Faust should look upon the type of man&rsquo;s harmonious
development, yet bound to obey, Mephistopheles sends him to
<span class="sc">the Mothers</span>,&mdash;the healthy primal instincts
and ideals of man which expressed themselves in the fair forms of art.
Corrupted by superstition of their own worshippers, cursed by
christianity, they &lsquo;have a Hades of their own,&rsquo; as
Mephistopheles says, and he is unwilling to interfere with them. The
image appears, and the sense of Beauty is awakened in Faust. But he is
still a christian as to his method: his idea is that heaven must be
taken by storm, by chance, wish, prayer, any means except patient
fulfilment of the conditions by which it may be reached. Helen is
flower of the history and culture of Greece; and so lightly Faust would
pluck and wear it!</p>
<p>Helen having vanished as he tried to clasp her, Faust has learned
his second lesson. When he next meets Helen it is not to seek
intellectual beauty as, in Gretchen&rsquo;s case, he had sought the
sensuous and sensual. He has fallen under a charm higher than that of
either Church or Mephistopheles; the divorce of ages between flesh and
spirit, the master-crime of superstition, from which all devils sprang,
was over for him from the moment that he sees the soul embodied and
body ensouled in the art-ideal of Greece.</p>
<p>The redemption of Faust through Art is the gospel of the nineteenth
century. This is her vesture which Helen leaves him when she vanishes,
and which bears him as a cloud to the land he is to make beautiful. The
purest Art&mdash;Greek Art&mdash;is an expression of Humanity: it can
as little be turned to satisfy a self-culture unhumanised as to consist
with a superstition which insults nature. When <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span>Faust can meet with Helen, and part without any
more clutching, he is not hurled back to his Gothic study and mocking
devil any more: he is borne away until he reaches the land where his
thought and work are needed. Blindness falls on him&mdash;or what
Theology deems such: for it is metaphorical&mdash;it means that he has
descended from clouds to the world, and the actual earth has eclipsed a
possible immortality.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The sphere of Earth is known enough to me;</p>
<p class="line">The view beyond is barred immortality:</p>
<p class="line">A fool who there his blinking eyes directeth,</p>
<p class="line">And o&rsquo;er his clouds of peers a place
expecteth!</p>
<p class="line">Firm let him stand and look around him well!</p>
<p class="line">This World means something to the capable;</p>
<p class="line">Why needs he through Eternity to wend?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The eye for a fictitious world lost, leaves the vision
for reality clearer. In every hard chaotic object Faust can now detect
a slumbering beauty. The swamps and pools of the unrestrained sea, the
oppressed people, the barrenness and the flood, they are all paths to
Helen&mdash;a nobler Helen than Greece knew. When he has changed one
scene of Chaos into Order, and sees a free people tilling the happy
earth, then, indeed, he has realised the travail of his manhood, and is
satisfied. To a moment which Mephistopheles never brought him, he cries
&lsquo;Stay, thou art fair!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mephistopheles now, as becomes a creation of the Theology of
obtaining what is not earned, calls up infernal troops to seize
Faust&rsquo;s soul, but the angels pelt them with roses. The roses
sting them worse than flames. The roses which Faust has evoked from
briars are his defence: they are symbols of man completing his nature
by a self-culture which finds its satisfaction in making some outward
desert rejoice and blossom like the rose. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most important remnant of the Odin myth is the
universal legend of the Wild Huntsman. The following variants are given
by Wuttke.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6762src" href="#xd26e6762" name=
"xd26e6762src">1</a> In Central and South Germany the Wild Hunt is
commonly called <span lang="de">W&uuml;tenden Heere</span>,
<i>i.e.</i>, Wodan&rsquo;s army or chase&mdash;called in the Middle
Ages, Wuotanges Heer. The hunter, generally supposed to be abroad
during the twelve nights after Christmas, is variously called
<span lang="xx">Wand, Waul, Wodej&auml;ger, Hellj&auml;ger,
Nightj&auml;ger, Hackelberg, Hackelberend</span> (man in armour),
<span lang="xx">Fro Gode, Banditterich, Jenner</span>. The most common
belief is that he is the spectre of a wicked lord or king who
sacrilegiously enjoyed the chase on Sundays and other holy days, and
who is condemned to expiate his sin by hunting till the day of doom. He
wears a broad-brimmed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href=
"#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>hat; is followed by dogs and other
animals, fiery, and often three-legged; and in his spectral train are
the souls of unbaptized children, huntsmen who have trodden down grain,
witches, and others&mdash;these being mounted on horses, goats, and
cocks, and sometimes headless, or with their entrails dragging behind
them. They rush with a fearful noise through the air, which resounds
with the cracking of whips, neighing of horses, barking of dogs, and
cries of ghostly huntsmen. The unlucky wight encountered is caught up
into the air, where his neck is wrung, or he is dropped from a great
height. In some regions, it is said, such must hunt until relieved, but
are not slain. The huntsman is a Nemesis on poachers or trespassers in
woods and forests. Sometimes the spectres have combats with each other
over battlefields. Their track is marked with bits of horseflesh, human
corpses, legs with shoes on. In some regions, it is said, the huntsmen
carry battle-axes, and cut down all who come in their way. When the
hunt is passing all dogs on earth become still and quiet. In most
regions there is some haunted gorge, hill, or castle in which the train
disappears.</p>
<p>In Thuringia, it is said that, when the fearful noises of the
spectral hunt come very near, they change to ravishing music. In the
same euphemistic spirit some of the prognostications it brings are not
evil: generally, indeed, the apparition portends war, pestilence, and
famine, but frequently it announces a fruitful year. If, in passing a
house, one of the train dips his finger in the yeast, the staff of life
will never be wanting in that house. Whoever sees the chase will live
long, say the Bohemians; but he must not hail it, lest flesh and bones
rain upon him.</p>
<p>In most regions, however, there is thought to be great danger in
proximity to the hunt. The perils are guarded against by prostration on
the earth face downward, praying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355"
href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span>meanwhile; by standing on a
white cloth (Bertha&rsquo;s linen), or wrapping the same around the
head; by putting the head between the spokes of a wheel; by placing
palm leaves on a table. The hunt may be observed securely from the
cross-roads, which it shuns, or by standing on a stump marked with
three crosses&mdash;as is often done by woodcutters in South
Germany.</p>
<p>Wodan also appears in the <span lang=
"de">Schimmelreiter</span>&mdash;headless rider on a white horse, in
Swabia called <span lang="de">Bachreiter</span> or <span lang=
"de">Junker J&auml;kele</span>. This apparition sometimes drives a
carriage drawn by four white (or black) horses, usually headless. He is
the terrible forest spectre Hoimann, a giant in broad-brimmed hat, with
moss and lichen for beard; he rides a headless white horse through the
air, and his wailing cry, &lsquo;Hoi, hoi!&rsquo; means that his reign
is ended. He is the bugbear of children.</p>
<p>In the Odinwald are the <i lang="de">Riesen&auml;ule</i> and
<i lang="de">Riesenaltar</i>, with mystic marks declaring them relics
of a temple of Odin. Near Erbach is Castle Rodenstein, the very
fortress of the Wild J&auml;ger, to which he passes with his horrid
train from the ruins of Schnellert. The village of Reichelsheim has on
file the affidavits of the people who heard him just before the battles
of Leipzig and Waterloo. Their theory is that if the J&auml;ger returns
swiftly to Schnellert all will go well for Germany; but if he tarry at
Rodenstein &rsquo;tis an omen of evil. He was reported near Frankfort
in 1832; but it is notable that no mention of him was made during the
late Franco-German war.</p>
<p>A somewhat later and rationalised variant relates that the wild
huntsman was Hackelberg, the Lord of Rodenstein, whose
tomb&mdash;really a Druidical stone&mdash;is shown at the castle, and
said to be guarded by hell-hounds. Hackelberg is of old his Brunswick
name. It was the Hackelberg Hill that opened to receive the children,
which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>Pied Piper of Hamelin charmed away with his
flute from that old town, because the corporation would not pay him
what they had promised for ridding them of rats. It is easy to trace
this Pied Piper, who has become so familiar through Mr. Robert
Browning&rsquo;s charming poem, to the Odin of more blessed memory, who
says in the Havamal, &lsquo;I know a song by which I soften and enchant
my enemies, and render their weapons of no effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This latter aspect of Odin, his command over vermin, connects him
with the Slavonic Lyeshy, or forest-demon of the Russias. The ancient
thunder-god of Russia, Perun, who rides in his storm-chariot through
the sky, has in the more christianised districts dropped his mantle on
Ilya (Elias); while in the greater number of Slavonic districts he has
held his original physical characters so remarkably that it has been
necessary to include him among demons. In Slavonian Folklore the
familiar myth of the wild huntsman is distributed&mdash;Vladimir the
Great fulfils one part of it by still holding high revel in the halls
of Kief, but he is no huntsman; Perun courses noisily through the air,
but he is rather benevolent than otherwise; the diabolical
characteristics of the superstition have fallen to the evil huntsmen
(Lyeshies), who keep the wild creatures as their flocks, the same as
shepherds their herds, and whom every huntsman must propitiate. The
Lyeshy is gigantic, wears a sheepskin, has one eye without eyebrow or
eyelash, horns, feet of a goat, is covered with green hair, and his
finger-nails are claws. He is special protector of the bears and
wolves.</p>
<p>In Denmark the same myth appears as King Volmer&rsquo;s Hunt.
Waldemar was so passionately fond of the chase that he said if the Lord
would only let him hunt for ever near Gurre (his castle in the north of
Seeland), he would not envy him his paradise. For this blasphemous wish
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>is condemned to hunt between Burre and Gurre for
ever. His cavalcade is much like that already described. Volmer rides a
snow-white charger, preceded by a pack of coal-black hounds, and he
carries his head under his left arm. On St. John the women open gates
for him. It is believed that he is allowed brief repose at one and
another of his old seats, and it is said spectral servants are
sometimes seen preparing the ruined castle at Vordingborg for him, or
at Waldemar&rsquo;s Tower. A sceptical peasant resolved to pass the
night in this tower. At midnight the King entered, and, thanking him
for looking after his tower, gave him a gold piece which burned through
his hand and fell to the ground as a coal. On the other hand, Waldemar
sometimes makes peasants hold his dogs, and afterwards throws them
coals which turn out to be gold pieces.</p>
<p>The Palnatoke or Palne Hunter appears mostly in the island of
<i>Fuen</i>. Every New Year&rsquo;s night he supplies himself with
three horse-shoes from some smithy, and the smith takes care that he
may find them ready for use on his anvil, as he always leaves three
gold pieces in their stead. If the shoes are not ready for him, he
carries the anvil off. In one instance he left an anvil on the top of a
church tower, and it caused the smith great trouble to get it down
again.</p>
<p>King Abel was interred after his death in St. Peter&rsquo;s Church
in Sleswig, but the fratricide could find no peace in his grave. His
ghost walked about in the night and disturbed the monks in their
devotions. The body was finally removed from the church, and sunk in a
foul bog near Gottorp. To keep him down effectively, a pointed stake
was drove through his body. The spot is still called K&ouml;nigsgrabe.
Notwithstanding this, he appears seated on a coal-black charger,
followed by a pack of black hounds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358"
href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>with eyes and tongues of
fire. The gates are heard slamming and opening, and the shrieks and
yells are such that they appal the stoutest hearts.</p>
<p>At the ancient capital of Fuen, Odense, said to have been built by
Odin, the myth has been reduced to a spectral Christmas-night equipage,
which issues from St. Canute&rsquo;s Church and passes to the ancient
manor-house of Glorup. It is a splendid carriage, drawn by six black
horses with fiery tongues, and in it are seated the Lords of Glorup,
famous for their cruelty to peasants, and now not able to rest in the
church where they were interred. It is of evil omen to witness the
spectacle: a man who watched for it was struck blind.</p>
<p>In France <i lang="fr">Le Grand Veneur</i> bears various names; he
is King Arthur, Saint Hubert, Hugo. His alleged appearances within
historic times have been so strongly attested that various attempts
have been made to give them rational explanations. Thus Charles VI. of
France, when going to war in Bretagne, is said to have been met by such
a spectre in the Forest of Mans, and became insane; he believed himself
to have been the victim of sorcery, as did many of his subjects. It has
been said that the King was met by a disguised emissary of the Duc de
Bretagne. More particular accounts are given of the apparition of the
Wild Huntsman to Henry IV. when he was hunting with the Comte de
Soissons in the Forest of Fontainebleau, an event commemorated by
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">La Croix du Grand Veneur</span>.&rsquo;
According to Matthieu,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6837src" href=
"#xd26e6837" name="xd26e6837src">2</a> both the King and the Count
heard the cries of the hunt, and when the Count went to discover their
origin, the terrible dark figure stood forth and cried, &lsquo;You wish
to see me, then behold!&rsquo; This incident has been explained
variously, as a project of assassination, or as the jest of two fellows
who, in 1596, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>were amusing Paris by their skill in imitating
all the sounds of a hunt. But such phantoms had too long hunted through
the imagination of the French peasantry for any explanation to be
required. Robert le Diable, wandering in Normandy till judgment-day,
and King Arthur, at an early date domesticated in France as a spectral
huntsman (the figure most popularly identified at the time with the
phantom seen by Henry IV.), are sufficient explanations. The ruins of
Arthur&rsquo;s Castle near Huelgoat, Finist&egrave;re, were long
believed to hide enormous treasures, guarded by demons, who appear
sometimes as fiery lights (<i lang="la">ignes fatuui</i>), owls,
buzzards, and ravens&mdash;one of the latter being the form in which
Arthur comes from his happy Vale of Avallon, when he would vary its
repose with a hunt.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6849src" href=
"#xd26e6849" name="xd26e6849src">3</a></p>
<p>A sufficiently curious interchange of such superstitions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>is represented in the following extract from
Surtees:&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang="en">Sir Anthon Bek, busshop of Dureme

<p>The legend of the Wild Huntsman tinges many old English stories.
Herne, the Hunter, may be identified with him, and the demons, with
ghostly and headless wish-hounds, who still hunt evil-doers over
Dartmoor on stormy nights, are his relations. The withered look of
horses grazing on Penzance Common was once explained by their being
ridden by demons, and the fire-breathing horse has found its way by
many weird routes to the service of the Exciseman in the
&lsquo;Ingoldsby Legends,&rsquo; or that of Earl Garrett, who rides
round the Curragh of Kildare on a steed whose inch-thick silver shoes
must wear as thin as a cat&rsquo;s ear, ere he fights the English and
reigns over Ireland. The Teutonic myth appears very plainly in the
story of Tregeagle. This man, traced to an old Cornish family, is said
to have been one of the wickedest men that ever lived; but though he
had disposed of his soul to the Devil, the evil one was baulked by the
potency of St. Petroc. This, however, was on condition of
Tregeagle&rsquo;s labouring at the impossible task of clearing the sand
from Porthcurnow Cove, at which work he may still be heard groaning
when wind and wave are high. Whenever he tries to snatch a
moment&rsquo;s rest, the demon is at liberty to pursue him, and they
may be heard on stormy nights in hot pursuit of the poor creature,
whose bull-like roar passed into the Cornish proverb, &lsquo;to roar
like Tregeagle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On a pleasant Sunday evening in July 1868, I witnessed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>&lsquo;<span lang="de">Der
Freisch&uuml;tz</span>&rsquo; in the newly-opened opera-house at
Leipzig. Never elsewhere have I seen such completeness and splendour in
the weird effects of the infernal scene in the Wolf&rsquo;s Glen. The
&lsquo;White Lady&rsquo; started forth at every step of <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e6906" title=
"Source: Caspar&rsquo;s">Rodolph&rsquo;s</span> descent to the glen,
warning him back. Zamiel, instead of the fiery garb he once wore as
Sama&euml;l, was arrayed in raiment black as night; and when the magic
bullet was moulded, the stage swarmed with huge reptiles, fiery
serpents crawled on the ground, a dragon-drawn chariot, with wheels of
fire, driven by a skeleton, passed through the air; and the wild
huntsman&rsquo;s chase, composed of animals real to the eye and
uttering their distinguishable cries, hurried past. The animals
represented were the horse, hound, boar, stag, chamois, raven, bat,
owl, and they rushed amid the wild blast of horns.</p>
<p>I could but marvel at the yet more strange and weird history of the
human imagination through which had flitted, from the varied regions of
a primitive world, the shapes combined in this apotheosis of diablerie.
Probably if Elijah in his fire-chariot, preached about in the
neighbouring church that morning, and this wild huntsman careering in
the opera, had looked closely at each other and at their own history,
they might have found a common ancestor in the mythical Mahan Bali of
India, the king whose austerities raised in power till he excited the
jealousy of the gods, until Vishnu crushed him with his heel into the
infernal regions, where he still exercises sovereignty, and is
permitted to issue forth for an annual career (at the Onam festival),
as described in Southey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Curse of Kehama.&rsquo; And they
might probably both claim mythological relationship with Yami, lord of
death, who, as Jami, began in Persia the career of all warriors that
never died, but sometimes sleep till a magic horn <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>shall awaken them, sometimes dwell, like Jami
himself and King Arthur, in happy isles, and in other cases issue forth
at certain periods for the chase or for war&mdash;like Odin and
Waldemar&mdash;with an infernal train.</p>
<p>But how did these mighty princes and warriors become demon
huntsmen?</p>
<p>In the Persian &lsquo;Desatir&rsquo; it is related that the animals
contested the superiority of man, the two orders of beings being
represented by their respective sages, and the last animal to speak
opposed the claim of his opponent that man attained elevation to the
nature of angels, with the remark, &lsquo;In his putting to death of
animals and similar acts man resembleth the beasts of prey, and not
angels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prophet of the world then said, &lsquo;We deem it sinful to kill
harmless, but right to slay ravenous, animals. Were all ravenous
animals to enter into a compact not to kill harmless animals, we would
abstain from slaying them, and hold them dear as ourselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the wolf made a treaty with the ram, and the lion became
friend of the stag. No tyranny was left in the world, till man (Dehak)
broke the treaty and began to kill animals. In consequence of this,
none observed the treaty except the harmless animals.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6922src" href="#xd26e6922" name="xd26e6922src">4</a></p>
<p>This fable, from the Aryan side, may be regarded as showing the
reason of the evil repute which gathered around the name of Dehak or
Zohak. The eating of animal food was among our Aryan ancestors probably
the provisional commissariat of a people migrating from their original
<i>habitat</i>. The animals slain for food had all their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>original consecration, and even the ferocious
were largely invested with awe. The woodcutters of Bengal invoke
Kalrayu&mdash;an archer tiger-mounted&mdash;to protect them against the
wild beasts he (a form of Siva) is supposed to exterminate; but while
the exterminator of the most dangerous animals may, albeit without
warrant in the Shastr, be respected in India, the huntsman is generally
of evil repute. The gentle Krishna was said to have been slain by an
arrow from the bow of Ungudu, a huntsman, who left the body to rot
under a tree where it fell, the bones being the sacred relics for which
the image of Jugernath at Orissa was constructed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6932src" href="#xd26e6932" name="xd26e6932src">5</a></p>
<p>It is not known at what period the notion of transmigration arose,
but that must have made him appear cannibalistic who first hunted and
devoured animals. Such was the Persian Zohak (or Dehak). His Babylonian
form, Nimrod, represented also the character of Esau, as huntsman; that
is, the primitive enemy of the farmer, and of the commerce in grains;
the preserver of wildness, and consequently of all those primitive
aboriginal idolatries which linger in the heaths (whence heathen) and
country villages (whence pagans) long after they have passed away from
the centres of civilisation. Hunting is essentially barbarous. The
willingness of some huntsmen even now, when this serious occupation of
an early period has become a sport, to sacrifice not only animal life
to their pleasure, but also the interests of labour and agriculture,
renders it very easy for us to understand the transformation of Nimrod
into a demon. In the Hebrew and Arabian legends concerning Nimrod, that
&lsquo;mighty hunter&rsquo; is shown as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>related to the wild
elements and their worshipper. When Abraham, having broken the images
of his father, was brought by Terah before Nimrod, the King said,
&lsquo;Let us worship the fire!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather the water that quenches the fire,&rsquo; said
Abraham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather the cloud that carries the water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the cloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather the wind that scatters the cloud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rather man, for he withstands the wind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou art a babbler,&rsquo; said Nimrod. &lsquo;I worship the
fire and will cast thee into it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Abraham was cast into the fiery furnace by Nimrod, and on the
seventh day after was found sitting amid the roses of a garden, the
mighty hunter&mdash;hater of gardens&mdash;resolved on a daring hunt
for Abraham&rsquo;s God himself. He built a tower five thousand cubits
high, but finding heaven still far away, he attached a car to two
half-starved eagles, and by holding meat above them they flew upward,
until Nimrod heard a voice saying, &lsquo;Godless man, whither goest
thou?&rsquo; The audacious man shot an arrow in the direction of the
voice; the arrow returned to him stained with blood, and Nimrod
believed that he had wounded Abraham&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>He who hunted the universe was destroyed by one of the weakest of
animated beings&mdash;a fly. In the aspiring fly which attacked
Nimrod&rsquo;s lip, and then nose, and finally devoured his brain, the
Moslem and Hebrew doctors saw the fittest end of one whose adventurous
spirit had not stopped to attack animals, man, Abraham, and Allah
himself.</p>
<p>But though, in one sense, destroyed, Nimrod, say various myths, may
be heard tumbling and groaning about the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>base of his tower of
Babel, where the confusion of tongues took place; and it might be
added, that they have, like the groan, a meaning irrespective of race
or language. Dehak and Nimrod have had their brothers in every race,
which has ever reached anything that may be called civilisation. It was
the barbaric Baron and the Robber Knight of the Middle Ages, living by
the hunt, who, before conversion, made for the Faithful Eckhardts of
the Church the chief impediment; they might then strike down the monk,
whose apparition has always been the legendary warning of the
Demon&rsquo;s approach. When the Eckhardts had baptized these knights,
they had already been transformed to the Devils which people the
forests of Germany, France, and England with their terrible spectres.
The wild fables of the East, telling of fell Demons coursing through
the air, whispered to the people at one ear, and the equally wild deeds
of the Robber Knights at the other. The Church had given the people one
name for all such phantasms&mdash;Devil&mdash;and it was a name
representative of the feelings of both priest and peasant, so long as
the Robber Knights were their common enemy. Jesus had to be a good deal
modified before he could become the model of this Teutonic Esau. It is
after the tradition of his old relation to huntsmen that the Devil has
been so especially connected in folklore with soldiers. In the
&lsquo;Annals of Leipzig,&rsquo; kept in Auerbach&rsquo;s Cellar,
famous for the flight of Mephisto and Faust from its window on a
wine-cask, I found two other instances in which the Devil was reported
as having appeared in that town. In one case (1604), the fiend had
tempted one Jeremy of Strasburg, a marksman, to commit suicide, but
that not succeeding, had desired him to go with him to the neighbouring
castle and enjoy some fruit. The marksman was saved by help of a Dean.
In 1633, during a period of excessive cold and snow, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>Devil induced a soldier to blaspheme. The
marksman and the soldier were, indeed, the usual victims of the Wild
Huntsmen&rsquo;s temptations; and it was for such that the unfailing
magic bullets were moulded in return for their impawned souls.</p>
<p>How King Olaf&mdash;whose name lingers among us in &lsquo;Tooley
Street,&rsquo; so famous for its Three Tailors!<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6968src" href="#xd26e6968" name="xd26e6968src">6</a>&mdash;spread
the Gospel through the North after his baptism in England is well
known. Whatever other hunt may have been phantasmal, it was not
Olaf&rsquo;s hunt of the heathen. To put a pan of live coals under the
belly of one, to force an adder down the throat of another, to offer
all men the alternatives of being baptized or burnt, were the arguments
which this apostle applied with such energy that at last&mdash;but not
until many brave martyrdoms&mdash;the chief people were convinced. Olaf
encountered Odin as if he had been a living foe, and what is more,
believed in the genuine existence of his former God. Once, as Olaf and
his friends believed, Odin appeared to this devastator of his altars as
a one-eyed man in broad-brimmed hat, delighting the King in his hours
of relaxation with that enchanting conversation for which he was so
famous. But he (Odin) tried secretly to induce the cook to prepare for
his royal master some fine meat which he had poisoned. But Olaf said,
&lsquo;Odin shall not deceive us,&rsquo; and ordered the tempting viand
to be thrown away. Odin was god of the barbarian Junkers, and the
people rejoiced that he was driven into holes and corners; his rites
remained mainly among huntsmen, and had to be kept very secret. In the
<i>Gulathings Lagen</i> of Norway it is ordered: &lsquo;Let the king
and bishop, with all possible care, search after those who exercise
pagan rites, who use magic arts, who adore the genii of particular
places, of tombs, or rivers, and who, after the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>manner of devils in travelling, are transported
from place to place through the air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under such very actual curses as these, the once sacred animals of
Odin, and all the associations of the hunt, were diabolised. Even the
hunting-horn was regarded as having something pr&aelig;ternatural about
it. The howling blast when Odin consulteth Mimir&rsquo;s head<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6978src" href="#xd26e6978" name="xd26e6978src">7</a>
was heard again in the Pied Piper&rsquo;s flute, and passed southward
to blend its note with the horn of Roland at Roncesvalles,&mdash;which
brought help from distances beyond the reach of any honest horn, and
even with the pipe of Pan.</p>
<p>That the Edda described Odin as mounted on a mysterious horse, as
cherishing two wolves for pets, having a roasted boar for the daily
<i lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> of his table, and
with a raven on either shoulder, whispering to him the secret affairs
of the earth, was enough to settle the reputation of those animals in
the creed of christian priests. The Raven was, indeed, from of old
endowed with the holy awfulness of the christian dove, in the Norse
Mythology. To this day no Swede will kill a raven. The superstition
concerning it was strong enough to transmit even to Voltaire an
involuntary shudder at its croak. Odin was believed to have given the
Raven the colour of the night that it might the better spy out the
deeds of darkness. Its &lsquo;natural theology&rsquo; is, no doubt,
given correctly by Robert Browning&rsquo;s Caliban, who, when his
speculations are interrupted by a thunderstorm, supposes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>his
soliloquy has been conveyed by the raven he sees flying to his god
Setebos. In many parts of Germany ravens are believed to hold souls of
the damned. If a raven&rsquo;s heart be secured it procures an unerring
shot.</p>
<p>From an early date the Boar became an ensign of the prowess of the
gods, by which its head passed to be the device of so many barbaric
clans and ancient families in the Northern world. In Vedic Mythology we
find Indra taking the shape of a Wild Boar, also killing a demon Boar,
and giving Tritas the strength by which a similar monster is
slain.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7012src" href="#xd26e7012" name=
"xd26e7012src">8</a> According to another fable, while Brahma and
Vishnu are quarrelling as to which is the first-born, Siva interferes
and cries, &lsquo;I am the first-born; nevertheless I will recognise as
my superior him who is able to see the summit of my head or the sole of
my feet.&rsquo; Vishnu, transforming himself to a Boar, pierced the
ground, penetrated to the infernal regions, and then saw the feet of
Siva, who on his return saluted him as first-born of the gods. De
Gubernatis regards this fable as making the Boar emblem of the hidden
Moon.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7015src" href="#xd26e7015" name=
"xd26e7015src">9</a> He is hunted by the Sun. He guards the treasure of
the demons which Indra gains by slaying him. In Sicilian story,
Zafarana, by throwing three hog&rsquo;s bristles on embers, renews her
husband&rsquo;s youth. In Esthonian legend, a prince, by eating pork,
acquires the faculty of understanding the language of
birds,&mdash;which may mean leading on the spring with its songs of
birds. But whether these particular interpretations be true or not,
there is no doubt that the Boar, at an early period, became emblematic
of the wild forces of nature, and from being hunted by King Odin on
earth passed to be his favourite food in Valhalla, and a prominent
figure in his spectral hunt.</p>
<p>Enough has already been said of the Dog in several <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>chapters of this work to render it but natural
that this animal should take his place in any diabolical train. It was
not as a &lsquo;hell-hound,&rsquo; or descendant of the guardians of
Orcus, that he entered the spectral procession of Odin, but as
man&rsquo;s first animal assistant in the work of obtaining a living
from nature. It is the faithful friend of man who is demoralised in
Waldemar&rsquo;s Lystig, the spectre-hound of Peel Castle, the Manthe
Doog of the Isle of Man, the sky-dogs (Cwn wybir or aunwy) of Wales,
and Roscommon dog of Ireland.</p>
<p>Of the Goat, the Dog, and some other diabolised animals, enough has
been said in previous pages. The nocturnal animals would be as
naturally caught up into the Wild Huntsman&rsquo;s train as belated
peasants. But it is necessary to dwell a little on the relations of the
Horse to this Wild Hunt. It was the Horse that made the primitive king
among men.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Horse,&rsquo; says Dasent, &lsquo;was a sacred animal
among the Teutonic tribes from the first moment of their appearance in
history; and Tacitus has related how, in the shade of those woods and
groves which served them for temples, white horses were fed at the
public cost, whose backs no mortal crossed, whose neighings and
snortings were carefully watched as auguries and omens, and who were
thought to be conscious of divine mysteries. In Persia, too, the
classical reader will remember how the neighing of a horse decided the
choice for the crown. Here in England, at any rate, we have only to
think of Hengist and Horsa, the twin heroes of the Anglo-Saxon
migration&mdash;as the legend ran&mdash;heroes whose name meant
<i>horse</i>, and of the Vale of the White Horse, in Berks, where the
sacred form still gleams along the down, to be reminded of the
sacredness of the horse to our forefathers. The Eddas are filled with
the names of famous horses, and the Sagas <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>contain many stories
of good steeds, in whom their owners trusted and believed as sacred to
this or that particular god. Such a horse is Dapplegrimm in the Norse
tales, who saves his master out of all his perils, and brings him to
all fortune, and is another example of that mysterious connection with
the higher powers which animals in all ages have been supposed to
possess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was believed that no warrior could approach Valhalla except on
horseback, and the steed was generally buried with his master. The
Scandinavian knight was accustomed to swear &lsquo;by the shoulder of a
horse and the edge of a sword.&rsquo; Odin (the god) was believed to
have always near him the eight-legged horse Sleipnir, whose sire was
the wonderful Svaldilfari, who by night drew the enormous stones for
the fortress defending Valhalla from the frost-giants. On Sleipnir the
deity rode to the realm of Hela, when he evoked the spirit of the
deceased prophetess, Vala, with Runic incantations, to learn
Baldur&rsquo;s fate. This is the theme of the Veytamsvida, paraphrased
by Gray in his ode beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Up rose the king of men with speed,</p>
<p class="line">And saddled straight his coal-black steed</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The steed, however, was not black, but grey. Sleipnir
was the foal of a magically-created mare. The demon-mare (Mara) holds a
prominent place in Scandinavian superstition, besetting sleepers. In
the Ynglinga Saga, Vanland awakes from sleep, crying, &lsquo;Mara is
treading on me!&rsquo; His men hasten to help him, but when they take
hold of his head Mara treads on his legs, and when they hold his legs
she tramples on his head; and so, says Thiodolf&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Trampled to death, to Skyta&rsquo;s shore</p>
<p class="line">The corpse his faithful followers bore;</p>
<p class="line">And there they burnt, with heavy hearts,</p>
<p class="line">The good chief, killed by witchcraft&rsquo;s arts.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span></p>
<p>All this is, of course, the origin of the common superstition of the
nightmare. The horse-shoe used against witches is from the same region.
We may learn here also the reason why hippophagy has been so long
unknown among us. Odin&rsquo;s boar has left his head on our Christmas
tables, but Olaf managed to rob us of the horse-flesh once eaten in
honour of that god. In the eleventh century he proclaimed the eating of
horse-flesh a test of paganism, as baptism was of Christianity, and
punished it with death, except in Iceland, where it was permitted by an
express stipulation on their embracing Christianity. To these facts it
may be added that originally the horse&rsquo;s head was lifted, as the
horse-shoe is now, for a charm against witches. When Wittekind fought
twenty years against Charlemagne, the ensign borne by his Saxon
followers was a horse&rsquo;s head raised on a pole. A white horse on a
yellow ground is to-day the Hanoverian banner, its origin being
undoubtedly Odinistic.</p>
<p>The christian edict against the eating of horse-flesh had probably a
stronger motive than sentimental opposition to paganism. A Roman
emperor had held the stirrup for a christian pontiff to mount, and
something of the same kind occurred in the North. The Horse, which had
been a fire-breathing devil under Odin, became a steed of the Sun under
the baptized noble and the bishop. Henceforth we read of coal-black and
snow-white horses, as these are mounted in the interest of the old
religion or the new.</p>
<p>It is very curious to observe how far and wide has gone religious
competition for possession of that living tower of strength&mdash;the
Horse. In ancient Ceylon we find the Buddhist immigrants winning over
the steed on which the aborigines were fortified. It was a white horse,
of course, that became their symbol of triumph. The old record
says&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;A certain yakkhini (demoness) named Chetiya, having the form
and countenance of a mare, dwelt near the marsh of Tumbariungona. A
certain person in the prince&rsquo;s (Pandukabhayo) retinue having seen
this beautiful (creature), white with red legs, announced the
circumstance to the prince. The prince set out with a rope to secure
her. She seeing him approach from behind, losing her presence of mind
from fear, under the influence of his imposing appearance, fled without
(being able to exert the power she possessed of) rendering herself
invisible. He gave chase to the fugitive. She, persevering in her
flight, made the circuit of the marsh seven times. She made three more
circuits of the marsh, and then plunged into the river at the
Kachchhaka ferry. He did the same, and (in the river) seized her by the
tail, and (at the same time grasped) the leaf of a palmira tree which
the stream was carrying down. By his supernatural good fortune this
(leaf) became an enormous sword. Exclaiming, &lsquo;I put thee to
death!&rsquo; he flourished the sword over her. &lsquo;Lord!&rsquo;
replied she to him, &lsquo;subduing this kingdom for thee, I will
confer it on thee: spare me my life.&rsquo; Seizing her by the throat,
and with the point of the sword boring her nostril, he secured her with
his rope: she (instantly) became tractable. Conducting her to the
Dhumarakkho mountain, he obtained a great accession of warlike power by
making her his battle-steed.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7060src"
href="#xd26e7060" name="xd26e7060src">10</a> The wonderful victories
won by the prince, aided by this magical mare, are related, and the
tale ends with his setting up &lsquo;within the royal palace itself the
mare-faced yakkhini,&rsquo; and providing for her annually &lsquo;demon
offerings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Equally ambiguous with the Horse in this zoologic diablerie is the
Stag. In the Heraklean legends we find <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>that hero&rsquo;s
son, Telephon, nursed by a hind in the woods; and on the other hand,
his third &lsquo;labour&rsquo; was the capture of Artemis&rsquo;
gold-antlered stag, which brought on him her wrath (it being &lsquo;her
majesty&rsquo;s favourite stag&rsquo;). We have again the story of
Act&aelig;on pursuing the stag too far and suffering the fate he had
prepared for it; and a reminiscence of it in the
&lsquo;Pentamerone,&rsquo; when the demon Huoreo allures Canneloro into
the wood by taking the form of a beautiful hind. These complex legends
are reflected in Northern folklore also. Count Otto I. of Altmark,
while out hunting, slept under an oak and dreamed that he was furiously
attacked by a stag, which disappeared when he called on the name of
God. The Count built a monastery, which still stands, with the
oak&rsquo;s stump built into its altar. On the other hand, beside the
altar of a neighbouring church hang two large horns of a stag said to
have brought a lost child home on its back. Thus in the old town of
Steindal meet these contrary characters of the mystical stag, of which
it is not difficult to see that the evil one results from its
misfortune in being at once the huntsman&rsquo;s victim and
scapegoat.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7067src" href="#xd26e7067" name=
"xd26e7067src">11</a></p>
<p>In the legend of St. Hubert we have the sign of Christ&mdash;risen
from his tomb among the rich Christians to share for a little the
crucifixion of their first missionaries in the North&mdash;to the
huntsmen of Europe. Hubert pursues the stag till it turns to face him,
and behold, between its antlers, the cross! It is a fable conceived in
the spirit of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>him who said to fishermen, &lsquo;Come with me
and I will make you fishers of men.&rsquo; The effect was much the same
in both cases. Hubert kneels before the stag, and becomes a saint, as
the fishermen left their nets and became apostles. But, as the proverb
says, when the saint&rsquo;s day is over, farewell the saint. The
fishermen&rsquo;s successors caught men with iron hooks in their jaws;
the successors of Hubert hunted men and women so lustily that they
never paused long enough to see whether there might not be a cross on
their forehead also.</p>
<p>It was something, however, that the cross which Constantine could
only see in the sky could be seen by any eye on the forehead of a
harmless animal; and this not only because it marked the rising in
christian hearts of pity for the animals, but because what was done to
the flying stag was done to the peasant who could not fly, and more
terribly. The vision of Hubert came straight from the pagan heart of
Western and Northern Europe. In the Bible, from Genesis to Apocalypse,
no word is found clearly inculcating any duty to the animals. So
little, indeed, could the christians interpret the beautiful tales of
folklore concerning kindly beasts, out of which came the legend of
Hubert, that Hubert was made patron of huntsmen; and while, by a
popular development, Wodan was degraded to a devil, the baptized
sportsman rescued his chief occupation by ascribing its most dashing
legends to St. Martin and their inspiration to the Archangel
Michael.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to consider the light which the German heart
cast across the dark shadows of Wodan. This is to be discovered in the
myth of the White Lady. We have already seen, in the confessions of the
witches of Elfdale, in Sweden, that when they were gathering before
their formidable Devil, a certain White Spirit warned them back. The
children said she tried to keep them from <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376</a>]</span>entering the
Devil&rsquo;s Church at Blockula. This may not be worth much as a
&lsquo;confession,&rsquo; but it sufficiently reports the theories
prevailing in the popular mind of Elfdale at that time. It is not
doubtful now that this White Lady and that Devil she opposed were, in
pre-christian time, Wodan and his wife Frigga. The humble people who
had gladly given up the terrible huntsman and warrior to be degraded
into a Devil, and with him the barbaric Nimrods who worshipped him, did
not agree to a similar surrender of their dear household goddess, known
to them as Frigga, Holda, Bertha, Mother Rose,&mdash;under all her
epithets the Madonna of the North, interceding between them and the
hard king of Valhalla, ages before they ever heard of a jealous Jehovah
and a tender interceding Mary.</p>
<p>Dr. Wuttke has collected many variants of the myths of Frigga, some
of which bear witness to the efforts of the Church to degrade her also
into a fiend. She is seen washing white clothes at fountains, milking
cows, spinning flax with a distaff, or combing her flaxen hair. She was
believed to be the divine ancestress of the human race; many of the
oldest families claimed descent from her, and believed that this
<span lang="de">Ahnenfrau</span> announced to them good fortune, or, by
her wailing, any misfortune coming to their families. She brought evil
only to those who spoke evil of her. If any one shoots at her the ball
enters his own heart. She appears to poor wandering folk, especially
children, and guides them to spots where they find heaps of gold
covered with the flower called
&lsquo;Forget-me-not&rsquo;&mdash;because her gentle voice is heard
requesting, as the only compensation, that the flowers shall be
replaced when the gold is removed. The primroses are sacred to her, and
often are the keys (thence called &lsquo;key-blossoms&rsquo;) which
unlock her treasures. The smallest tribute she repays,&mdash;even a
pebble consecrated to her. Every child ascending <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>the
Burgeiser Alp places a stone on a certain heap of such, with the words,
&lsquo;Here I offer to the wild maidens.&rsquo; These are
Bertha&rsquo;s kindly fairies. (When Frederika Bremer was with a picnic
on the Hudson heights, which Washington Irving had peopled with the
Spirits he had brought from the Rhine, she preferred to pour out her
champagne as a libation to the &lsquo;good spirits&rsquo; of Germany
and America.) The beautiful White Lady wears a golden chain, and
glittering keys at her belt; she appears at mid-day or in strong
moonlight. In regions where priestly influence is strong she is said to
be half-black, half-white, and to appear sometimes as a serpent. She
often helps the weary farmer to stack his corn, and sorely-tasked
Cinderellas in their toil.</p>
<p>In pre-christian time this amiable goddess&mdash;called oftenest
Bertha (shining) and Mother Rose&mdash;was related to Wodan as the
spring and summer to the storms of winter, in which the Wild
Huntsman&rsquo;s procession no doubt originated. The Northman&rsquo;s
experience of seed-time and harvest was expressed in the myth of this
sweet Rose hidden through the winter&rsquo;s blight to rise again in
summer. This myth has many familiar variants, such as <span lang=
"de">Aschenputtel</span> and Sleeping Beauty; but it was more
particularly connected with the later legends of the White Lady, as
victim of the Wild Huntsman, by the stories of transformed princesses
delivered by youths. Rescue of the enchanted princess is usually
effected by three kisses, but she is compelled to appear before the
deliverer in some hideous aspect&mdash;as toad or serpent; so that he
is repelled or loses courage. This is the rose hid under the ugliness
of winter.</p>
<p>When the storm-god Wodan was banished from nature altogether and
identified with the imported, and naturally inconceivable, Satan, he
was no more regarded as Frigga&rsquo;s rough lord, but as her
remorseless foe. She was popularly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378"
href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>revered as St. Walpurga, the
original May Queen, and it was believed that happy and industrious
children might sometimes see her on May-day with long flowing flaxen
hair, fine shoes, distaff in hand, and a golden crown on her head. But
for the nine nights after May-day she was relentlessly pursued by the
Wild Huntsman and his mounted train. There is a picture by G. Watts of
the hunted lady of Bocaccio&rsquo;s tale, now in the Cosmopolitan Club
of London, which vividly reproduces the weird impressiveness of this
myth. The White Lady tries to hide from her pursuer in standing corn,
or gets herself bound up in a sheaf. The Wild Huntsman&rsquo;s wrath
extends to all her retinue,&mdash;moss maidens of the wood, or
Holtzweibeln. The same belief characterises Waldemar&rsquo;s hunt. It
is a common legend in Denmark that King Volmer rode up to some
peasants, busy at harvest on Sobjerg Hill, and, in reply to his
question whether they had seen any game, one of the men
said&mdash;&lsquo;Something rustled just now in yonder standing
corn.&rsquo; The King rushed off, and presently a shot was heard. The
King reappeared with a mermaid lying across his horse, and said as he
passed, &lsquo;I have chased her a hundred years, and have her at
last.&rsquo; He then rode into the hill. In this way Frigga and her
little people, hunted with the wild creatures, awakened sympathy for
them.</p>
<p>The holy friar. Eckhardt (who may be taken as a myth and type of the
Church <i>ad hoc</i>) gained his legendary fame by being supposed to go
in advance of the Wild Huntsman and warn villagers of his approach; but
as time went on and a compromise was effected between the hunting
Barons and the Church, on the basis that the sports and cruelties
should be paid for with indulgence-fees, Eckhardt had to turn his
attention rather to the White Lady. She was declared a Wild Huntress,
but the epithet slipped to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href=
"#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>other shoulders. The priests
identified her ultimately with Freija, or Frau Venus; and Eckhardt was
the holy hermit who warned young men against her sorceries in Venusberg
and elsewhere. But Eckhardt never prevailed against the popular love of
Mother Rose as he had against her pursuer; he only increased the
attractions of &lsquo;Frau Venus&rsquo; beyond her deserts. In the end
it was as much as the Church could do to secure for Mary the mantle of
her elder sister&rsquo;s sanctity. Even then the earlier faith was not
eradicated. After the altars of Mary had fallen, Frigga had vitality
enough to hold her own as the White Witch who broke the Dark
One&rsquo;s spells. It was chiefly this helpful Mother-goddess to whom
the wretched were appealing when they were burnt for witchcraft.</p>
<p>At Urselberg, Wurtemberg, there is a deep hole called the
&lsquo;Nightmaidens&rsquo; Retreat,&rsquo; in which are piled the
innumerable stones that have been cast therein by persons desiring good
luck on journeys. These stones correspond to the bones of the 11,000
Virgins in St. Ursula&rsquo;s Church at Cologne. The White Lady was
sainted under her name of Ursel (the glowing one), otherwise Horsel.
Horselberg, near Eisenach, became her haunt as Venus, the temptress of
Tannha&uuml;sers; Urselberg became her retreat as the good fairy
mother; but the attractions of herself and her moss-maidens, which the
Church wished to borrow, were taken on a long voyage to Rome, and there
transmuted to St. Ursula and her 11,000 Virgins. These Saints of
Cologne encountered their ancient mythical pursuers&mdash;the Wild
Huntsman&rsquo;s train&mdash;in those barbarian Huns who are said to
have slaughtered them all because they would not break their vows of
chastity. The legend is but a variant of Wodan&rsquo;s hunt after the
White Lady and her maidens. When it is remembered that before her
transformation by Christianity Ursula was the Huntsman&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>own wife, Frigga, a quaint incident appears in
the last meeting between the two. After Wodan had been transformed to
the Devil, he is said to have made out the architectural plan for
Cologne Cathedral, and offered it to the architect in return for a bond
for his soul; but, having weakly allowed him to get possession of the
document before the bond was signed, the architect drew from under his
gown a bone of St. Ursula, from which the Devil fled in great terror.
It was bone of his bone; but after so many mythological vicissitudes
Wodan and his Horsel could hardly be expected to recognise each other
at this chance meeting in Cologne. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381"

universal myth of Sleepers,&mdash;christianised in the myth of St.
John, and of the Seven whose slumber is traceable as far as
Tours,&mdash;had a direct pagan development in Jami, Barbarossa,
Arthur, and their many variants. It is the legend of the Castle of
Sewingshields in Northumberland, that King Arthur, his queen and court,
remain there in a subterranean hall, entranced, until some one should
first blow a bugle-horn near the entrance hall, and then with
&lsquo;the sword of the stone&rsquo; cut a garter placed there beside
it. But none had ever heard where the entrance to this enchanted hall
was, till a farmer, fifty years since, was sitting knitting on the
ruins of the castle, and his clew fell and ran downwards through briars
into a deep subterranean passage. He cleared the portal of its weeds
and rubbish, and entering a vaulted passage, followed the clew. The
floor was infested with toads and lizards; and bats flitted fearfully
around him. At length his sinking courage was strengthened by a dim,
distant light, which, as he advanced, grew gradually brighter, till all
at once he entered a vast and vaulted hall, in the centre of which a
fire, without fuel, from a broad crevice in the floor, blazed with a
high and lambent flame, that showed all the carved walls and fretted
roof, and the monarch and his queen and court reposing around in a
theatre of thrones and costly couches. On the floor, beyond the fire,
lay the faithful and deep-toned pack of thirty couple of hounds; and on
a table before it the spell-dissolving horn, sword, and garter. The
shepherd firmly grasped the sword, and as he drew it from its rusty
scabbard the eyes of the monarch and his courtiers began to open, and
they rose till they sat upright. He cut the garter, and as the sword
was slowly sheathed the spell assumed its ancient power, and they all
gradually sank to rest; but not before the monarch had lifted up his
eyes and hands and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The phrase which heads this chapter is a favourite one
in France. It may have had a euphemistic origin, for the giants dreaded
by primitive Europeans were too formidable to be lightly spoken of. But
within most of the period concerning which we have definite knowledge
such phrases would more generally have expressed the half-contemptuous
pity with which these huge beings with weak intellects were regarded.
The Devil imported with Christianity was made over, as we have seen,
into the image of the Dummeteufel, or stupid good-natured giant, and he
is represented in many legends which show him giving his gifts and
services for payments of which he is constantly cheated. Le Bon Diable
in France is somewhat of this character, and is often taken as the sign
of tradesmen who wish to represent themselves as lavishing their goods
recklessly for inadequate compensation. But the large accession of
demons and devils from the East <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382"
href="#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>through Jewish and Moslem
channels, of a character far from stupid, gave a new sense to that
phrase and corresponding ones. There is no doubt that a very distinct
reaction in favour of the Devil arose in Europe, and one expressive of
very interesting facts and forces. The pleasant names given him by the
masses would alone indicate this,&mdash;Monsieur De Scelestat, Lord
Voland, Bl&uuml;mlin (floweret), Federspiel (gay-plumed), Maitre
Bernard, Maitre Parsin (Parisian).</p>
<p><i>The Devil is not so black as he&rsquo;s painted.</i> This proverb
concerning the long-outlawed Evil One has a respectable antiquity, and
the feeling underlying it has by no means been limited to the vulgar.
Even the devout George Herbert wrote&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">It is hard to destroy the natural sentiments of the
human heart. However much they may be overlaid by the transient
exigencies of a creed, their indestructible nature is pretty certain to
reveal itself. The most orthodox supporters of divine cruelty in their
own theology will cry out against it in another. The saint who is quite
satisfied that the everlasting torture of Satan or Judas is justice,
will look upon the doom of Prometheus as a sign of heathen
heartlessness; and the burning of one widow for a few moments on her
husband&rsquo;s pyre will stimulate merciful missionary ardour among
millions of christians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href=
"#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>whose creed passes the same poor
victim to endless torture, and half the human race with her.</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether the general theological conception of the
functions of Satan is consistent with the belief that he is in a state
of suffering. As an agent of divine punishment he is a part of the
divine government; and it is even probable that had it not been for the
necessity of keeping up his office, theology itself would have found
some means of releasing him and his subordinates from hell, and
ultimately of restoring them to heaven and virtue.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e7152src" href="#xd26e7152" name="xd26e7152src">1</a></p>
<p>It is a legend of the island Iona that when St. Columba attempted to
build a church there, the Devil&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the same Druid
magicians who tried to prevent his landing there by
tempests&mdash;threw down the stones as often as they were piled up. An
oracle declared that the church could arise only after some holy man
had been buried alive at the spot, and the saint&rsquo;s friend Orain
offered himself for the purpose. After Orain had been buried, and the
wall was rising securely, St. Columba was seized with a strong desire
to look upon the face of his poor friend once more. The wall was pulled
down, the body dug up; but instead of Orain being found dead, he sat up
and told <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>the assembled christians around him that he had
been to the other world, and discovered that they were in error about
various things,&mdash;especially about Hell, which really did not exist
at all. Outraged by this heresy the christians immediately covered up
Orain again in good earnest.</p>
<p>The resurrection of this primitive universalist of the seventh
century, and his burial again, may be regarded as typifying a dream of
the ultimate restoration of the universe to the divine sway which has
often given signs of life through christian history, though many times
buried. The germ of it is even in Paul&rsquo;s hope that at last
&lsquo;God may be all in all&rsquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=

Luke x. 17</a>, also, it was related that the seventy whom Jesus had
sent out among the idol-worshipping Gentiles &lsquo;returned again with
joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy
name.&rsquo; These ideas are recalled in various legends, such as that
elsewhere related of the Satyr who came to St. Anthony to ask his
prayers for the salvation of his demonic tribe. On the strength of
Anthony&rsquo;s courteous treatment of that Satyr, the famous
Consulteur of the Inquisition, Father Sinistrari (seventeenth century),
rested much of his argument that demons were included in the atonement
wrought by Christ and might attain final beatitude. The Father affirmed
that this was implied in Christ&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;Other sheep I
have which are not of this flock: them also I must bring, and they
shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold and one
shepherd&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7171src" href="#xd26e7171"

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2010:16&amp;version=NRSV">John
x. 16</a>). That these words were generally supposed to refer to the
inclusion of the Gentile world was not accepted by Sinistrari as
impairing his argument, but the contrary. He maintained with great
ingenuity that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385"
name="pb385">385</a>]</span>salvation of the Gentiles logically
includes the salvation of their inspiring demons, and that there would
not be one fold if these aerial beings, whose existence all authorities
attested, were excluded. He even intimates, though more timidly, that
their father, Satan himself, as a participator in the sin of Adam and
sharer of his curse, may be included in the general provision of the
deity for the entire and absolute removal of the curse throughout
nature.</p>
<p>Sinistrari&rsquo;s book was placed on the &lsquo;<span lang=
"la">Index Expurgatorius</span>&rsquo; at Rome in 1709,
&lsquo;<span lang="la">donec corrigatur</span>,&rsquo; eight years
after the author&rsquo;s death; it was republished, &lsquo;<span lang=
"la">correctus</span>,&rsquo; 1753. But the fact that such sentiments
had occupied many devout minds in the Church, and that they had reached
the dignity of a consistent and scholarly statement in theology, was
proved. The opinion grew out of deeper roots than New Testament phrases
or the Anthony fables. The Church had been for ages engaged in the vast
task of converting the Gentile world; in the course of that task it had
succeeded only by successive surrenders of the impossible principles
with which it had started. The Prince of this World had been baptized
afresh with every European throne ascended by the Church. Asmodeus had
triumphed in the sacramental inclusion of marriage; St. Francis
d&rsquo;Assisi, preaching to the animals, represented innumerable pious
myths which had been impossible under the old belief in a universal
curse resting upon nature. The evolution of this tendency may be traced
through the entire history of the Church in such sects as the
Paulicians, Cathari, Bogomiles, and others, who, though they again and
again formulated anew the principle of an eternal Dualism, as often
revealed some further stage in the progressive advance of the
christianised mind towards a normal relation with nature. Thus the
Cathari maintained that only those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386"
href="#pb386" name="pb386">386</a>]</span>beings who were created by
the evil principle would remain unrecovered; those who were created by
God, but seduced by the Adversary, would be saved after sufficient
expiation. The fallen angels, they believed, were passing through
earthly, in some cases animal, bodies to the true Church and to heaven.
Such views as these were not those of the learned, but of the
dissenting sects, and they prepared ignorant minds in many countries
for that revival of confidence in their banished deities which made the
cult of Witchcraft.</p>
<p>St. Thomas Aquinas, the &lsquo;Angelical Doctor,&rsquo; in his
famous work &lsquo;<span lang="la">Summa Theologi&aelig;</span>,&rsquo;
maintains that in the Resurrection the bodies of the redeemed will rise
with all their senses and organs, including those of sex, active and
refined. The authentic affirmation of that doctrine in the thirteenth
century was of a significance far beyond the comprehension of the
Church. Aquinas confused the lines between flesh and spirit, especially
by admitting sex into heaven. The Devil could not be far behind. The
true interpretation of his doctrine is to be found in the legend that
Aquinas passed a night in prayer for the salvation and restoration of
the Devil. This legend is the subject of a modern poem so fraught with
the spirit of the medi&aelig;val heart, pining in its dogmatic prison,
that I cannot forbear quoting it here:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">While this might be the feeling of devout philosophers
whose minds were beginning to form a conception of a Cosmos in which
the idea of a perpetual empire of Evil could find no place, the humble
and oppressed masses, as we have seen in the chapter on Witchcraft,
were familiarising their minds with the powers and glories of a Satan
in antagonism to the deities and saints of the Church. It was not a
penitent devil supplicating for pardon whom they desired, but the
veritable Prince of the World, to whom as well as to themselves their
Christian oppressors were odious. They invested the Powers which the
priests pronounced infernal with those humanly just and genial
qualities that had been discarded by ecclesiastical ambition. The
legends which must be interpreted in this sense are very numerous, and
a few of the most characteristic must suffice us here. The habit of
attributing every mishap to the Devil was rebuked in many legends. One
of these related that when a party were driving over a rough road the
waggon broke down and one of the company exclaimed, &lsquo;This is a
bit of the Devil&rsquo;s work!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>A gentleman present
said, &lsquo;It is a bit of corporation work. I don&rsquo;t believe in
saddling the Devil with all the bad roads and bad axles.&rsquo; Some
time after, when this second speaker was riding over the same road
alone, an old gentleman in black met him, and having thanked him for
his defence of the Devil, presented him with a casket of splendid
jewels. Very numerous are legends of the Devil&rsquo;s apparition to
assist poor architects and mechanics unable to complete their
contracts, even carving beautiful church pillars and the like for them,
and this sometimes without receiving any recompense. The Devil&rsquo;s
apparition in defence of accused innocence is a well-known feature of
European folklore. On one occasion a soldier, having stopped at a
certain inn, confided to the innkeeper some money he had for
safe-keeping, and when he was about to leave the innkeeper denied
having received the deposit. The soldier battered down the door, and
the neighbours of the innkeeper, a prominent man in the town, put him
in prison, where he lay in prospect of suffering death for an attempted
burglary. The poor soldier, being a stranger without means, was unable
to obtain counsel to defend him. When the parties appeared before the
magistrate, a smart young lawyer, with blue hat and white feathers,
unknown in the town, volunteered to defend the soldier, and related the
whole story with such effect that the innkeeper in his excitement
cried, &lsquo;Devil take me if I have the money!&rsquo; Instantly the
smart lawyer spread his wings, and, seizing the innkeeper, disappeared
with him through the roof of the court-room. The innkeeper&rsquo;s
wife, struck with horror, restored the money. In an Altmark version of
this story the Devil visits the prisoner during the previous night and
asks for his soul as fee, but the soldier refuses, saying he had rather
die. Despite this the Devil intervened. It was an old-time custom in
Denmark for courts to sit with an open <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>window, in order that
the Devil might more easily fly away with the perjurer.</p>
<p>Always a democrat, the Devil is said in many stories to have
interfered in favour of the peasant or serf against the noble. On one
occasion he relieved a certain district of all its arrogant and idle
noblemen by gathering them up in a sack and flying away with them; but
unhappily, as he was passing over the town of Friesack, his sack came
in collision with the church steeple, and through the hole so torn a
large number of noble lords fell into the town&mdash;which thence
derived its name&mdash;and there they remained to be patrons of the
steeple and burthens on the people.</p>
<div class="figure fig23width" id="fig23"><img src="images/fig223.png"

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 23.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Wicked
Ale-wife.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The Devil was universally regarded as a Nemesis on all publicans and
ale-wives who adulterated the beer they dealt out to the people, or
gave short measures. At Reetz, in Altmark, the legend of an ale-wife
with whom he flew away is connected with a stone on which they are said
to have rested, and the villagers see thereon prints of the
Devil&rsquo;s hoof and the woman&rsquo;s feet. This was a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>favourite theme of old English legends. The
accompanying Figure (<a href="#fig23">23</a>), one of the misereres in
Ludlow parish church, Shropshire, represents the end of a wicked
ale-wife. A devil on one side reads the long list of her shortcomings,
and on the other side hell-mouth is receiving other sinners. A devil
with bagpipe welcomes her arrival. She carries with her only her
fraudulent measure and the fashionable head-dress paid for out of its
wicked gains.</p>
<p>In a marionette performance which I witnessed at Tours, the
accusations brought against the tradesmen who cheated the people were
such as to make one wish that the services of some equally strict devil
could be secured by the authorities of all cities, to detect
adulterators and dealers in false weights and measures. The same
retributive agency, in the popular interest, was ascribed to the Devil
in his attitude towards misers. There being no law which could reach
men whose hoarded wealth brought no good to themselves or others, such
were deemed proper cases for the interposition of the Devil. There is a
significant contrast between the legends favoured by the Church and
those of popular origin. The former, made prominent in frescoes, often
show how, at the weighing of souls, the sinner is saved by a saint or
angel, or by some instance of service to the Church being placed in the
scale against the otherwise heavier record of evil deeds. A
characteristic legend is that which is the subject of the frescoes in
the portico of St. Lorenzo Church at Rome (thirteenth century). St.
Lawrence sees four devils passing his hermitage, and learns from them
that they are going for the soul of Henry II. In the next scene, when
the wicked Count is weighed, the scroll of his evil deeds far outweighs
that of his good actions, until the Saint casts into the scale a
chalice which the prince had once given to his church. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>For
that one act Henry&rsquo;s soul ascends to paradise amid the
mortification of the Devils. Though Charles Martel saved Europe from
Saracen sway, he once utilised episcopal revenues for relief of the
state; consequently a synod declares him damned, a saint sees him in
hell, a sulphurous dragon issues from his grave. On the other hand, the
popular idea of the fate of distinguished sinners may be found hid
under misereres, where kings sometimes appear in Hell, and in the early
picture-books which contained a half-christianised folklore.</p>
<p>It has been observed that the early nature-deities, reflecting the
evil and good of nature, in part through the progress of human thought
and ideality, and through new ethnical rivalries, were degraded into
demons. They then represented the pains, obstructions, and fears in
nature. We have seen that as these apparent external evils were
vanquished or better understood, the demons passed to the inward
nature, and represented a new series of pains, obstructions, and fears.
But these, too, were in part vanquished, or better understood. Still
more, they so changed their forms that the ancient demons-turned-devils
were no longer sufficiently expressive to represent them. Thus we find
that the Jews, mohammedans, and christians did not find their several
special antagonists impressively represented by either Satan, Iblis, or
Beelzebub. Each, therefore, personified its foe in accordance with
later experiences&mdash;an Opponent called Armillus, Aldajjail,
Antichrist (all meaning the same thing), in whom all other devils were
merged.</p>
<p>As to their spirit; but as to their forms they shrank in size and
importance, and did duty in small ways. We have seen how great dragons
were engaged in frightening boys who fished on Sundays, or oppressive
squires; how Satan presided over wine-casks, or was adapted to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>punishment of profanity; how hosts of once
tremendous fiends turned into the grotesque little forms which Callot,
truly copying the popular notions around him, painted as motley imps
disturbing monks at their prayers. Such diminutions of the devils
correspond to a parallel process among the gods and goddesses, by which
they were changed to &lsquo;little people&rsquo; or fairies. In both
cases the transformation is an expression of popular disbelief in their
reality.</p>
<p>But revivals took place. The fact of evil is permanent; and whenever
the old chains of fear, after long rusting, finally break, there
follows an insurrection against the social and moral order which alarms
the learned and the pious. These see again the instigations of evil
powers, and it takes form in the imagination of a Dante, a Luther, a
Milton. But when these new portraits of the Devil are painted, it is
with so much contemporary colouring that they do not answer to the
traditional devils preserved in folklore. Dante&rsquo;s Worm does not
resemble the serpent of fable, nor does Milton&rsquo;s Satan answer to
the feathered clown of Miracle Plays. Thus, behind the actual evils
which beset any time, there stands an array of grand diabolical names,
detached from present perils, on which the popular fancy may work
without really involving any theory of Absolute Evil at all. Were
starry Lucifer to be restored to his heavenly sphere, he would be one
great brand plucked from the burning, but the burning might still go
on. Theology itself had filled the world with other devils by
diabolising all the gods and goddesses of rival religions, and the
compassionate heart was thus left free to select such forms or fair
names as preserved some remnant of ancient majesty around them, or some
ray from their once divine halo, and pray or hope for their pardon and
salvation. Fallen foes, no longer able to harm, can hardly fail to
awaken pity and clemency. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href=
"#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span></p>
<p>With the picture of Dives and Lazarus presented elsewhere (vol. i.
p. 281) may be instructively compared the accompanying scene of a rich
man&rsquo;s death-bed (<a href="#fig24">Fig. 24</a>), taken from
&lsquo;Ars Moriendi,&rsquo; one of the early block-books. This picture
is very remarkable from the suggestion it contains of an opposition
between a devil on the dying man&rsquo;s right and the hideous dragon
on his left. While the dragon holds up a scroll, bidding him think of
his treasure (<i>Yntende thesauro</i>), the Devil suggests provision
for his friends (<i lang="la">Provideas amicis</i>). This devil seems
to be a representative of the rich man&rsquo;s relatives who stand
near, and appears to be supported by his ugly superior, who points
towards hell as the penalty of not making such provision as is
suggested. There would appear to be in this picture a vague distinction
between the mere bestial fiend who tempts, and the ugly but
good-natured devil who punishes, and whom rich sinners cannot escape by
bequests to churches.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the most notable signs of the appearance of &lsquo;the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>good Devil&rsquo; was the universal belief that
he invariably stuck to his word. In all European folklore there is no
instance of his having broken a promise. In this respect his reputation
stands far higher than that of the christians, seeing that it was a
boast of the saints that, following the example of their godhead, who
outwitted Satan in the bargain for man&rsquo;s redemption, they were
continually cheating the Devil by technical quibbles. There is a
significant saying found among Prussian and Danish peasants, that you
may obtain a thing by calling on Jesus, but if you would be sure of it
you must call on the Devil! The two parties were judged by their
representatives.</p>
<p>One of the earliest legendary compacts with the Devil was that made
by St. Theophilus in the sixth century; when he became alarmed and
penitent, the Virgin Mary managed to trick Satan out of the fatal bond.
The &lsquo;Golden Legend&rsquo; of Jacobus de Voragine tells why Satan
was under the necessity of demanding in every case a bond signed with
blood. &lsquo;The christians,&rsquo; said Satan, &lsquo;are cheats;
they make all sorts of promises so long as they want me, and then leave
me in the lurch, and reconcile themselves with Christ so soon as, by my
help, they have got what they want.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even apart from the consideration of possessing the soul, the
ancient office of Satan as legal prosecutor of souls transmitted, to
the latest forms into which he was modified, this character for
justice. Many medi&aelig;val stories report his gratitude whenever he
is treated with justice, though some of these are disguised by
connection with other demonic forms. Such is the case with the
following romance concerning Charlemagne.</p>
<p>When Charlemagne dwelt at Zurich, in the house commonly called
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Zum Loch</span>,&rsquo; he had a column erected
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>which a bell was attached by a rope. Any one
that demanded justice could ring this bell when the king was at his
meals. It happened one day that the bell sounded, but when the servants
went to look no one was there. It continued ringing, so the Emperor
commanded them to go again and find out the cause. They now remarked
that an enormous serpent approached the rope and pulled it. Terrified,
they brought the news to the Emperor, who immediately rose in order to
administer justice to beast as well as man. After the reptile had
respectfully inclined before the emperor, it led him to the banks of
the river and showed him, sitting upon its nest and eggs, an enormous
toad. Charlemagne having examined the case decided thus:&mdash;The toad
was condemned to be burnt and justice shown to the serpent. The verdict
was no sooner given than it was accomplished. A few days after the
snake returned to court, bowed low to the King, crept upon the table,
took the cover from a gold goblet standing there, dropped into it a
precious stone, bowed again and crept away. On the spot where the
serpent&rsquo;s nest had been, Charlemagne built a church called
&lsquo;<span lang="de">Wasserkelch</span>.&rsquo; The stone he gave to
his much-loved spouse. This stone possessed the power of making the
owner especially loved by the Emperor, so that when absent from his
queen he mourned and longed for her. She, well aware that if it came
into other hands the Emperor would soon forget her, put it under her
tongue in the hour of death. The queen was buried with the stone, but
Charlemagne could not separate himself from the body, so had it
exhumed, and for eighteen years carried it about with him wherever he
went. In the meantime, a courtier who had heard of the secret virtue of
the stone, searched the corpse, and at last found the stone hidden
under the tongue, and took it away and concealed it on his own person.
Immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>the Emperor&rsquo;s love for his wife turned to
the courtier, whom he now scarcely permitted out of his sight. At
Cologne the courtier in a fit of anger threw the stone into a hot
spring, and since then no one has succeeded in finding it. The love the
Emperor had for the knight ceased, but he felt himself wonderfully
attracted to the place where the stone lay hidden. On this spot he
founded Aix-la-Chapelle, his subsequent favourite place of
residence.</p>
<p>It is not wonderful that the tradition should arise at Aix, founded
by the human hero of this romance, that the plan of its cathedral was
supplied by the Devil; but it is characteristic there should be
associated with this legend an example of how he who as a serpent was
awarded justice by Charlemagne was cheated by the priests of Aix. The
Devil gave the design on condition that he was to have the first who
entered the completed cathedral, and a wolf was goaded into the
structure in fulfilment of the contract!</p>
<p>In the ancient myth and romaunt of &lsquo;Merlin&rsquo; may be found
the medi&aelig;val witness to the diabolised religion of Britain. The
emasculated saints of the South-east could not satisfy the vigorous
race in the North-west, and when its gods were outlawed as devils they
brought the chief of them back, as it were, had him duly baptized and
set about his old work in the form of Merlin! Here, side by side with
the ascetic Jesus, brought by Gatien and Augustin, was a Northern
Christ, son of an Arch-incubus, born of a Virgin, baptized in the
shrunken Jordan of a font, performing miracles, summoning dragons to
his aid, overcoming Death and Hell in his way, brought before his
Pilate but confounding him, throning and dethroning kings, and leading
forth, on the Day of Pentecost, an army whose knights are inspired by
Guenever&rsquo;s kisses in place of flaming tongues. How Merlin
&lsquo;went about doing good,&rsquo; after <span class=

Northman&rsquo;s ideal of such work; how he saved the life of his
unwedded mother by proving that her child (himself) was begotten by a
devil without her knowledge; how, as a child, he exposed at once the
pretension of the magistrate to high birth and the laxity of his lady
and his parson; how he humiliated the priestly astrologers of
Vortigern, and prophesied the destruction of that usurper just as it
came to pass; how he served Uther during his seven years&rsquo; reign,
and by enabling him to assume the shape of the Duke of Cornwall and so
enjoy the embraces of the Duchess Igerna, secured the birth of Arthur
and hope of the Sangr&eacute;al;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7424src"

Arthur&rsquo;s legitimacy of birth and assisted him in causing
illegitimate births; and how at last he was bound by his own spells,
wielded by Vivien, in a prison of air where he now remains;&mdash;this
was the great medi&aelig;val gospel of a baptized christian Antichrist
which superseded the imported kingdom not of this world.</p>

<p>Merlin was the Good Devil, but baptism was a fatal Vivien-spell to
him. He still dwells in all the air which is breathed by Anglo-Saxon
men,&mdash;an ever-expanding prison! Whether the Briton is transplanted
in America, India, or Africa, he still carries with him the Sermon on
the Mount as inspired by his baptized Prince of the Air, and his gospel
of the day is, &lsquo;If thine enemy hunger, starve him; if he thirst,
give him fire; if he hate you, heap melted lead on his head!&rsquo;
Such remains the soul of the greatest race, under the fatal spell of a
creed that its barbarism needs only baptism to be made holiness and
virtue. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=

<p>In the reign of George II., when Lord Bute and a Princess of easy
virtue were preying on England, and fanatical preachers were directing
their donkeys to heaven beside the conflagration of John Bull&rsquo;s
house, the eye of Hogarth at least (as is shown in our Figure 25, from
his &lsquo;Raree Show&rsquo;) was able to see what the baptized Merlin
had become in his realm of Air. The other worldly-Devil is
serpent-legged Hypocrisy. The Nineteenth Century has replaced Merlin by
Mephistopheles, the Devil who, despite a cloven foot, steps firmly on
earth, and means the power that wit and culture can bring against the
baptized giant Force. Him the gods fear not, even look upon with
satisfaction. In the &lsquo;Prologue in Heaven,&rsquo; of
Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faust,&rsquo; the Lord is even more gracious to
Mephistopheles than the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href=

<p class="first">This is but a more modern expression of the rabbinical
fable, already noted, that when the first man was formed there were
beside him two Spirits,&mdash;one on the right that remained quiescent,
another on the left who ever moved restlessly up and down. When the
first sin was committed, he of the left was changed to a devil. But he
still meant the progressive, inquiring nature of man. &lsquo;The Spirit
I, that evermore denies,&rsquo; says the Mephistopheles of Goethe. How
shall man learn truth if he know not the Spirit that denies? How shall
he advance if he know not the Spirit of discontent? This restless
spirit gains through his ignorance a cloven hoof,&mdash;a divided
movement, sometimes right, sometimes wrong. From his selfishness it
acquires a double tongue. But both hoof and serpent-tongue are beneath
the evolutional power of experience; they shall be humanised to the
foot that marches firmly on earth, and the tongue that speaks truth;
and, the baptismal spell broken, Merlin shall descend, bringing to
man&rsquo;s aid all his sharp-eyed dragons transformed to beautiful

pre-petrified era of Theology this hope appears to have visited the
minds of some, Origen for instance. But by many centuries of
utilisation the Devil became so essential to the throne of Christianity
that theologians were more ready to spare God from their system than
Satan. &lsquo;Even the clever Madame de Sta&euml;l,&rsquo; said Goethe,
&lsquo;was greatly scandalised that I kept the Devil in such
good-humour. In the presence of God the Father, she insisted upon it,
he ought to be more grim and spiteful. What will she say if she sees
him promoted a step higher,&mdash;nay, perhaps, meets him in
heaven?&rsquo; Though, in another conversation with Falk, Goethe
intimates that he had written a passage &lsquo;where the Devil himself
receives grace and mercy from God,&rsquo; the artistic theory of his
poem could permit no nearer approach to this than those closing lines
(Faust, II.) in which Mephistopheles reproaches the
&lsquo;case-hardened Devil&rsquo; and himself for their mismanagement.

<p class="first">&lsquo;The christians,&rsquo; said Celsus,
&lsquo;dream of some antagonist to God&mdash;a devil, whom they call
Satanas, who thwarted God when he wished to benefit mankind. The Son of
God suffered death from Satanas, but they tell us we are to defy him,
and to bear the worst he can do; Satanas will come again and work
miracles, and pretend to be God, but we are not to believe him. The
Greeks tell of a war among the gods; army against army, one led by
Saturn, and one by Ophincus; of challenges and battles; the vanquished
falling into the ocean, the victors reigning in heaven. In the
Mysteries we have the rebellion of the Titans, and the fables of
Typhon, and Horus, and Osiris. The story of the Devil plotting against
man is stranger than either of these. The Son of God is injured by the
Devil, and charges us to fight against him at our peril. Why not punish
the Devil instead of threatening poor wretches whom he
deceives?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7465src" href="#xd26e7465"
name="xd26e7465src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href=

<p>The christians comprehended as little as their critic that story
they brought, stranger than all the legends of besieged deities, of a
Devil plotting against man. Yet a little historic perspective makes the
situation simple: the gods had taken refuge in man, therefore the
attack was transferred to man.</p>
<p>Priestly legends might describe the gods as victorious over the
Titans, the wild forces of nature, but the people, to their sorrow,
knew better; the priests, in dealing with the people, showed that they
also knew the victory to be on the other side. A careful writer
remarks:&mdash;&lsquo;When these (Greek) divinities are in any case
appealed to with unusual seriousness, their nature-character
reappears&#8202;&hellip;. When Poseidon hesitates to defer to the
positive commands of Zeus (Il. xix. 259), Iris reminds him that there
are the Erinnyes to be reckoned with (Il. xv. 204), and he gives in at
once.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7473src" href="#xd26e7473" name=
"xd26e7473src">2</a> The Erinnyes represent the steady supremacy of the
laws and forces of nature over all personifications of them. Under
uniform experience man had come to recognise his own moral autocracy in
his world. He looked for incarnations, and it was a hope born of an
atheistic view of external nature. This was the case not only with the
evolution of Greek religion, but in that of every religion.</p>
<p>When man&rsquo;s hope was thus turned to rest upon man, he found
that all the Titans had followed him. Ophincus (Ophion) had passed
through Ophiomorphus to be a Man of Sin; and this not in one, but by
corresponding forms in every line of religious development. The
ferocities of outward nature appeared with all their force in man, and
renewed their power with the fine armoury of his intelligence. He must
here contend with tempests of passion, stony selfishness, and the whole
animal creation nestling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href=
"#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>in heart and brain, prowling
still, though on two feet. The theory of evolution is hardly a century
old as science, but it is an ancient doctrine of Religion. The fables
of Pilpay and &AElig;sop represent an early recognition of
&lsquo;survivals.&rsquo; Recurrence to original types was recognised as
a mystical phenomenon in legends of the bandit turned wolf, and other
transformations. One of the oldest doctrines of Eschatology is
represented in the accompanying picture (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>),
from Thebes, of two dog-headed apes ferrying over to Hades a gluttonous
soul that has been weighed before Osiris, and assigned his appropriate
form.</p>

<p>The devils of Lust are so innumerable that several volumes would be
required to enumerate the legends and superstitions connected with
them. But, fortunately for my reader and myself, these, more than any
other class of phantoms, are very slight modifications of the same
form. The innumerable phallic deities, the incubi and succub&aelig;,
are monotonous as the waves of the ocean, which might fairly typify the
vast, restless, and stormy expanse of sexual nature to which they
belong.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;The Golden Legend&rsquo; there is a pleasant tale of a
gentleman who, having fallen into poverty, went into solitude, and was
there approached by a chevalier in black, mounted on a fine horse. This
knight having inquired the reason of the other&rsquo;s sadness,
promised him that, if he would return home, he would find at a certain
place vast <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>sums of gold; but this was on condition that he
should bring his beautiful wife to that solitary spot in exactly a
year&rsquo;s time. The gentleman, having lived in greater splendour
than ever during the year, asked his wife to ride out with him on the
appointed day. She was very pious, and having prayed to the Virgin,
accompanied her husband to the spot. There the gentleman in black met
them, but only to tremble. &lsquo;Perfidious man!&rsquo; he cried,
&lsquo;is it thus you repay my benefits? I asked you to bring your
wife, and you have brought me the Mother of God, who will send me back
to hell!&rsquo; The Devil having vanished, the gentleman fell on his
knees before the Virgin. He returned home to find his wife sleeping
quietly.</p>
<p>Were we to follow this finely-mounted gentleman in black, we should
be carried by no uncertain steps back to those sons of God who took
unto themselves wives of the daughters of men, as told in Genesis; and
if we followed the Virgin, we should, by less certain but yet probable
steps, discover her prototype in Eve before her fall, virginal as she
was meant to remain so far as man was concerned. In the chapters
relating to the Eden myth and its personages, I have fully given my
reasons for believing that the story of Eve, the natural childlessness
of Sarah, and the immaculate conception by Mary, denote, as sea-rocks
sometimes mark the former outline of a coast, a primitive theory of
celibacy in connection with that of a divine or Holy Family. It need
only be added here that this impossible ideal in its practical
development was effectual in restraining the sexual passions of
mankind. Although the reckless proclamation of the wild nature-gods
(Elohim), &lsquo;Be fruitful and multiply,&rsquo; has been accepted by
christian bibliolators as the command of Jehovah, and philanthropists
are even punished for suggesting means of withstanding the effects
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>of nuptial licentiousness, yet they are farther
from even the letter of the Bible than those protestant celibates, the
American Shakers, who discard the sexual relation altogether. The
theory of the Shakers that the functions of sex &lsquo;belong to a
state of nature, and are inconsistent with a state of grace,&rsquo; as
one of their members in Ohio stated it to me, coincides closely with
the rabbinical theory that Adam and Eve, by their sin, fell to the
lowest of seven earthly spheres, and thus came within the influence of
the incubi and succub&aelig;, by their union with whom the world was
filled with the demonic races, or Gentiles.</p>
<p>It is probable that the fencing-off of Eden, the founding of the
Abrahamic household and family, and the command against adultery, were
defined against that system of rape&mdash;or marriage by
capture&mdash;which prevailed among the &lsquo;sons of Elohim,&rsquo;
who saw the &lsquo;daughters of men that they were fair,&rsquo; and
followed the law of their eyes. The older rabbins were careful to
preserve the distinction between the <i>Bene Elohim</i> and the
<i>Ischim</i>, and it ultimately amounted to that between Jews and
Gentiles.</p>
<p>The suspicion of a devil lurking behind female beauty thus begins.
The devils love beauty, and the beauties love admiration. These are
perils in the constitution of the family. But there are other legends
which report the frequency with which woman was an unwilling victim of
the lustful Anakim or other powerful lords. Throughout the world are
found legends of beautiful virgins sacrificed to powerful demons or
deities. These are sometimes so realistic as to suggest the possibility
that the fair captives of savage chieftains may indeed have been
sometimes victims of their Ogre&rsquo;s voracity as well as his lust.
At any rate, cruelty and lust are nearly related. The Blue Beard myth
opens out horrible possibilities. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406"

<p>One of the best-known legends in Japan is that concerning the fiend
Shudendozi, who derives his name from the two characteristics of
possessing the face of a child and being a heavy drinker. The
child-face is so emphasised in the stories that one may suspect either
that his fair victims were enticed to his stronghold by his air of
innocence, or else that there is some hint as to maternal longings in
the fable.</p>

</div>
<p>At the beginning of the eleventh century, when Ichijo II. was
Emperor, lived the hero Yorimitsa. In those days the people of Kiyoto
were troubled by an evil spirit which abode near the Rasho Gate. One
night, when merry with his companions, Ichijo said, &lsquo;Who dare go
and defy the demon of the Rasho Gate, and set up a token that he has
been there?&rsquo; &lsquo;That dare I,&rsquo; answered Tsuma, who,
having donned his mail, rode out in the bleak night to the Rasho Gate.
Having written his name on the gate, returning, his horse shivers with
fear, and a huge hand coming out of the gate seized the knight&rsquo;s
helmet. He struggled in vain. He then cuts off the demon&rsquo;s arm,
and the demon flies howling. Tsuma takes the demon&rsquo;s arm home,
and locks it in a box. One night the demon, having the shape of
Tsuma&rsquo;s aunt, came and said, &lsquo;I pray you show me the arm of
the fiend.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will show it to no man, and yet to thee will
I show it,&rsquo; replied he. When the box is opened a black cloud
enshrouds the aunt, and the demon disappears with the arm. Thereafter
he is more troublesome than ever. The demon carried off the fairest
virgins of Kiyoto, ravished and ate them, no beauty being left in the
city. The Emperor commands Yorimitsa to destroy him. The hero, with
four trusty knights and a great captain, went to the hidden places of
the mountains. They fell in with an old man, who invited them into his
dwelling, and gave them wine to drink; and when they were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>going he presented them with wine. This old man
was a mountain-god. As they proceeded they met a beautiful lady washing
blood from garments in a valley, weeping bitterly. In reply to their
inquiries she said the demon had carried her off and kept her to wash
his clothes, meaning when weary of her to eat her. &lsquo;I pray your
lordships to help me!&rsquo; The six heroes bid her lead them to the
ogre&rsquo;s cave. One hundred devils mounted guard before it. The
woman first went in and told him they had come. The ogre called them
in, meaning to eat them. Then they saw Shudendozi, a monster with the
face of a little child. They offered him wine, which flew to his head:
he becomes merry and sleeps, and his head is cut off. The head leaps up
and tries to bite Yorimitsa, but he had on two helmets. When all the
devils are slain, he brings the head of Shudendozi to the Emperor. In a
similar story of the same country the lustful ogre by no means
possesses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>Shudendozi&rsquo;s winning visage, as may be
seen by the popular representation of him (<a href="#fig27">Fig.
27</a>), with a knight&rsquo;s hand grasping his throat.</p>
<p>A Singhalese demon of like class is Bahirawa, who takes his name
from the hill of the same name, towering over Kandy, in which he is
supposed to reside. The legend runs that the astrologers told a king
whose queen was afflicted by successive miscarriages, that she would
never be delivered of a healthy child unless a virgin was sacrificed
annually on the top of this hill. This being done, several children
were borne to him. When his queen was advanced in years the king
discontinued this observance, and consequently many diseases fell upon
the royal family and the city, after which the annual sacrifice was
resumed, and continued until 1815, when the English occupied Kandy. The
method of the sacrifice was to bind a young girl to a stake on the top
of the hill with jungle-creepers. Beside her, on an altar, were placed
boiled rice and flowers; incantations were uttered, and the girl left,
to be generally found dead of fright in the morning. An old woman, who
in early years had undergone this ordeal, survived, and her safety no
doubt co-operated with English authority to diminish the popular fear
of Bahirawa, but still few natives would be found courageous enough to
ascend the hill at night.</p>
<p>One of the lustful demons of Ceylon is Calu Cumara, that is, the
Black Prince. He is supposed to have seven different
apparitions,&mdash;prince of fire, of flowers, of groves, of graves, of
eye-ointments, of the smooth body, and of sexuality. The Saga says he
was a Buddhist priest, who by exceeding asceticism and accumulated
merits had gained the power to fly, but passion for a beautiful woman
caused him to fall. By disappointment in the love for which he had
parted with so much his heart was broken, and he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>became a demon. In this condition he is for ever
tortured by the passion of lustful desire, the only satisfaction of
which he can obtain being to afflict young and fair women with illness.
He is a very dainty demon, and can be soothed if great care is taken in
the offerings made to him, which consist of rice of finest quality,
plantains, sugar-cane, oranges, cocoa-nuts, and cakes. He is of
dark-blue complexion and his raiment black.</p>
<p>In Singhalese demonolatry there are seven female demons of lust,
popularly called the Madana Yaksenyo. These sisters are&mdash;Cama
(lust); Cini (fire); Mohanee (ignorance); Rutti (pleasure); Cala
(maturity); Mal (flowers); Puspa (perfumes). They are the abettors of
seduction, and are invoked in the preparation of philtres.<a class=

<p class="first">Many traditions preceded this ungallant creed, some of
which have been referred to in our chapters on Lilith and Eve.
Corresponding to these are the stories related by Herodotus of the
overthrow of the kingdom of the Heraclid&aelig; and freedom of the
Greeks, through the revenge of the Queen, &lsquo;the most beautiful of
women,&rsquo; upon her husband Candaules for having contrived that
Gyges <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>should see her naked. Candaules having been
slain by Gyges at the instigation of the Queen, and married her, the
Fates decreed that their crime should be punished on their fifth
descendant. The overthrow was by Cyrus, and it was associated with
another woman, Mandane, daughter of the tyrant Astyages, mother of
Cyrus, who is thus, as the Madonna, to bruise the head of the serpent
who had crept into the Greek Paradise.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7568src" href="#xd26e7568" name="xd26e7568src">6</a> The Greeks
of Pontus also ascribed the origin of the Scythian race, the scourge of
all nations, to a serpent-woman, who, having stolen away the mares
which Herakles had captured from Gergon, refused to restore them except
on condition of having children by him. From the union of Herakles with
this &lsquo;half virgin, half viper,&rsquo; sprang three sons, of whom
the youngest was Scythes.</p>

(Japanese).</p>
</div>
<p>Not only are feminine seductiveness and liability to seduction
represented in the legends of female demons and devils, but quite as
much the jealousy of that sex. If the former were weaknesses which
might overthrow kingdoms, the latter was a species of animalism which
could devastate the home and society. Although jealousy is sometimes
regarded as venial, if not indeed a sign of true love, it is an outcome
of the animal nature. The Japanese have shown a true observation of
nature in portraying their female Oni (devil) of jealousy (<a href=
"#fig28">Fig. 28</a>) with sharp erect horns and bristling hair. The
raising &lsquo;of the ornamental <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411"
href="#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span>plumes by many birds during
their courtship,&rsquo; mentioned by Mr. Darwin, is the more pleasing
aspect of that emotion which, blending with fear and rage, puffs out
the lizard&rsquo;s throat, ruffles the cock&rsquo;s neck, and raises
the hair of the insane.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7587src" href=
"#xd26e7587" name="xd26e7587src">7</a></p>
<p>An ancient legend mingles jealousy with the myth of Eden at every
step. Rabbi Jarchi says that the serpent was jealous of Adam&rsquo;s
connubial felicity, and a passage in Josephus shows that this was an
ancient opinion. The jealousy of Adam&rsquo;s second wife felt by his
first (Lilith) was by many said to be the cause of her conspiracy with
the serpent. The most beautiful medi&aelig;val picture of her that I
have seen was in an illuminated Bible in Strasburg, in which, with all
her wealth of golden hair and her beauty, Lilith holds her mouth, with
a small rosy apple in it, towards Adam. Eve seems to snatch it. Then
there is an old story that when Eve had eaten the apple she saw the
angel of death, and urged Adam to eat the fruit also, in order that he
might not become a widower.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that there should have sprung up a legend that
Satan made his second attack upon the race formed by Jehovah, and his
plan for perpetuating it on earth by means of a flirtation with
Noah&rsquo;s wife, and also by awakening her jealousy. The older legend
concerning Noah&rsquo;s wife is that mentioned by Tabari, which merely
states that she ridiculed the predictions of a deluge by her husband.
So much might have been suggested by the silence of the Bible
concerning her. The Moslem tradition that the Devil managed to get into
the ark is also ancient. He caught hold of the ass&rsquo;s tail just as
it was about to enter. The ass came on slowly, and Noah, becoming
impatient, exclaimed, &lsquo;You cursed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb412" href="#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span>one, come in
quick!&rsquo; When Noah, seeing the Devil in the ark, asked by what
right he was there, the other said, &lsquo;By your order; you said,
&ldquo;Accursed one, come in;&rdquo; I am the accursed one!&rsquo; This
story, which seems contrived to show that one may not be such an ass as
he looks, was superseded by the legend which represents Satan as having
been brought into the ark concealed under Noria&rsquo;s (or
Noraita&rsquo;s) dress.</p>

<p>The most remarkable legend of this kind is that found in the Eastern
Church, and which is shown in various medi&aelig;val designs in Russia.
Satan is shown, in an early sixteenth century picture belonging to
Count Uvarof (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>), offering Noah&rsquo;s wife
a bunch of <i>khmel</i> (hops) with which to brew <i>kvas</i> and make
Noah drunk; for the story was that Noah did not tell his wife that a
deluge was coming, knowing that she could not keep a secret. In the old
version of the legend given by Buslaef, &lsquo;after apocryphal
tradition used by heretics,&rsquo; Satan always addresses Noah&rsquo;s
wife as <i>Eve</i>, which indicates a theory. It was meant to be
considered as a second edition of the attack on the divine plan begun
in Eden, and revived in the temptation of Sara. Satan not only taught
this new Eve how to make <i>kvas</i> but also <i>vodka</i> (brandy);
and when he had awakened her jealousy about Noah&rsquo;s frequent
absence, he bade her <span class="corr" id="xd26e7624" title=
"Source: substitue">substitute</span> the brandy for the beer when her
husband, as usual, asked for the latter. When Noah was thus in his cups
she asked him where he went, and why he kept late hours. He revealed
his secret to his Eve, who disclosed it to Satan. The tempter appears
to have seduced her from Noah, and persuaded her to be dilatory when
entering the ark. When all the animals had gone in, and all the rest of
her family, Eve said, &lsquo;I have forgotten my pots and pans,&rsquo;
and went to fetch them; next she said, &lsquo;I have forgotten my
spoons and forks,&rsquo; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href=
"#pb413" name="pb413">413</a>]</span>returned for them. All of this had
been arranged by Satan in order to make Noah curse; and he had just
slipped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span>under Eve&rsquo;s skirt when he had the
satisfaction of hearing the intended Adam of a baptized world cry to
his wife, &lsquo;Accursed one, come in!&rsquo; Since Jehovah himself
could not prevent the carrying out of a patriarch&rsquo;s curse, Satan
was thus enabled to enter the ark, save himself from being drowned, and
bring mischief into the human world once more.</p>
<p>This is substantially the same legend as that of the medi&aelig;val
Morality called &lsquo;Noah&rsquo;s Ark, or the Shipwright&rsquo;s
Ancient Play or Dirge.&rsquo; The Devil says to Noah&rsquo;s
wife:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Yes, hold thee still le dame,</p>
<p class="line">And I shall tell thee how;</p>
<p class="line">I swear thee by my crooked snout,</p>

<p class="line">Is little to thy profit.</p>
<p class="line">Yet shall I tell thee how</p>
<p class="line">Thou shalt meet all his will;</p>
<p class="line">Do as I shall bid thee now,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">There are some intimations in the Slavonic version
which look as if it might have belonged to some Paulician or other
half-gnostic theory that the temptation of Noraita (Eve II.), and her
alienation from her husband, were meant to prevent the repopulation of

<p>The next attempt of the Devil, as agent of the Elohistic creation,
to ruin the race of man, introduces us to another form of animalism
which has had a large expression in Devil-lore. It is related in
rabbinical mythology that when, as is recorded in <a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%209:20&amp;version=NRSV">
Gen. ix. 20</a>, Noah was planting a vineyard, the Devil (Asmodeus)
came and proposed to join him in the work. This having been agreed to,
this evil partner brought in succession a sheep, a lion, and a hog, and
sacrificed them on the spot. The result was that the wine when drunk
first gave the drinker the quality of a sheep, then that of a lion, and
finally that of a hog.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7682src" href=
"#xd26e7682" name="xd26e7682src">9</a> It was by this means that Noah
was reduced to swinish inebriation. There followed the curses on those
around him, which, however drunken, were those of a father, and
reproduced on the cleansed world all the dooms which had been
pronounced in Eden.</p>
<p>If the date of this legend could be made early enough, it would
appear to be a sort of revenge for this temptation of Noah to
drunkenness that Talmudic fable shows Asmodeus brought under bondage to
Solomon, and forced to work on the Temple, by means of wine. Asmodeus
had dug for himself a well, and planted beside it a tree, so making for
himself a pleasant spot for repose during his goings to and fro on
earth. But Solomon&rsquo;s messenger Benaja managed to cover this with
a tank which he filled with wine. Asmodeus, on his return, repeated to
himself the proverb, &lsquo;Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging,
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise&rsquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=prov%2020:1&amp;version=NRSV">Prov.
xx. 1</a>); yet, being very thirsty, he drank, fell asleep, and when he
awoke found himself loaded with chains.</p>
<p>However, after working for a time for Solomon, he discovered that
king&rsquo;s weaknesses and played upon them. Solomon was so puffed up
with a sense of his power that he accepted a challenge from his slave
(Asmodeus) to show his superiority without the assistance of his magic
ring, and without keeping his competitor in bonds. No sooner was
Asmodeus free, and in possession of the ring, than he transported
Solomon four hundred miles away, where he remained for a long time
among the seductive beauties of the Courts of Naamah, Rahab, and other
she-devils. Meanwhile the Devil, assuming the form of Solomon, sat on
his throne, and became the darling of his Queen and concubines.</p>
<p>The Devil of Wine and strong drink generally has a wide
representation in folklore. We find him in the bibulous Serpent of
Japan, who first loses his eight heads metaphorically, and then
literally from the first of Swords-men. The performances of
Mephistopheles in Auerbach&rsquo;s Cellar are commemorated in its old
frescoes, and its motto: &lsquo;Live, drink, carouse, remembering Faust
and his punishment: it came slowly, but was in ample measure.&rsquo;
Thuringian legends relate that the Devil tries to stop the building of
churches by casting down the stones, but this may be stopped by the
builders promising to erect a winehouse in the same neighbourhood. An
old English legend relates that a great man&rsquo;s cellar was haunted
by devils who drank up his wine. On one occasion a barrel was marked
with holy water, and the devil was found stuck fast on it.</p>
<p>Gluttony, both in eating and drinking, has had its many
personifications. The characteristics of the Hunger <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=
"pb417">417</a>]</span>demons are travestied in such devils as these,
only the diabolical, as distinguished from the demonic element, appears
in features of luxuriousness. The contrast between the starveling
saints of the early Church and the well-fed friars of later times was a
frequent subject of caricature, as in the accompanying example
(<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>) from the British Museum, fourteenth
century (MS. Arundel), where a lean devil is satisfying himself through
a fattened friar. One of the most significant features of the old
legend of Faust is the persistence of the animal character in which
Mephistopheles appears. He is an ugly dog&mdash;a fit emblem of the
scholar&rsquo;s relapse into the canine temper which flies at the world
as at a bone he means to gnaw. Faust does not like this genuine form,
and bids the Devil change it. Mephistopheles then takes the form of a
Franciscan friar; but &lsquo;the kernel of the brute&rsquo; is in him
still, and he at once loads Faust&rsquo;s table with luxuries and wines
from the cellars of the Archbishop of Salzburg and other rich priests.
The prelates are fond of their bone too. When Mephistopheles and Faust
find their way into the Vatican, it is to witness carousals of the Pope
and his Cardinals. They snatch from them their luxuries and
wine-goblets as they are about to enjoy them. Against these invisible
invaders the holy men bring their crucifixes and other powers of
exorcism; and it is all snarling and growling&mdash;canine priest
against puppy astrologer. Nor was it very different in the history of
the long contention between the two for the big bone of
Christendom.</p>

<p>The lust of Gold had its devils, and they were not different from
other types of animalism. This was especially the case with such as
represented money, extorted from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418"
href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>the people to supply wealth
to dissolute princes and prelates. The giants of Antwerp represent the
power of the pagan monarchs who exacted tribute; but these were
replaced by such guardians of tribute-money as the Satyr of our picture
(<a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>), which Edward the Confessor saw seated
on a barrel of Danegeld,</p>

<p class="line">Vit un d&eacute;able saer desus</p>
<p class="line">Le tresor, noir et hidus.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There are many good fables in European folklore with
regard to the miser&rsquo;s gold, and &lsquo;devil&rsquo;s money&rsquo;
generally, which exhibit a fine instinct. A man carries home a package
of such gold, and on opening it there drop out, instead of money, paws
and nails of cats, frogs, and bears&mdash;the latter being an almost
personal allusion to the Exchange. A French miser&rsquo;s money-safe
being opened, two frogs only were found. The Devil could not get any
other soul than the gold, and the cold-blooded reptiles were left as a
sign of the life that had been lived.</p>

<p>In the legends of the swarms of devils which beset St. Anthony we
find them represented as genuine animals. Our Anglo-Saxon fathers,
however, were quite unable to appreciate the severity of the conflict
which man had to wage with the animal world in Southern countries and
in earlier times. Nor had their reverence for nature and its forms been
crushed out by the pessimist theory of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>earth maintained by Christianity. Gradually the
representation of the animal tempters was modified, and instead of real
animal forms there were reported the bearded bestialities which
surrounded St. Guthlac and St. Godric. The accompanying picture
(<a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>) is a group from Breughel (1565),
representing the devils called around St. James by a magician. These
grotesque forms will repay study. If we should make a sketch of the
same kind, only surrounding the saint with the real animal shapes most
nearly resembling these nondescripts, it would cease to be a diabolical
scene.</p>

<p>For beastliness is not a character of beasts; it is the arrest of
man. It is not the picturesque donkey in the meadow that is ridiculous,
but the donkey on two feet; not the bear of zoological gardens that is
offensive morally, but the rough, who cannot always be caged; it is the
two-legged calf, the snake pretending to be a man, the ape in evening
dress, who ever made the problem of evil at all formidable. It was
insoluble until men had discovered as Science that law of Evolution
which the ancient world knew as Ethics.</p>
<p>A Hindu fable relates that the animals, in their migration, came to
an abyss they could not cross, and that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span>gods
made man as a bridge across it. Science and Reason confirm these
ancient instincts of our race. Man is that bridge stretching between
the animal and the ideal habitat by which, if the development be
normal, all the passions pass upward into educated powers. Any pause or
impediment on that bridge brings all the animals together to rend and
tear the man who cannot convey them across the abyss. A very slight
arrest may reveal to a man that he is a vehicle of intensified
animalism. The lust of the goat, the pride of the peacock, the wrath of
the lion, beautiful in their appropriate forms, become, in the guise of
a man uncontrolled by reason, the vices which used to be called
possession, and really are insanities. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

giving of Eve&rsquo;s name to Noah&rsquo;s wife is not the only
significant thing about this Russian tradition and its picture.
Long-bearded devils are nowhere normal except in the representations by
the Eastern Church of the monarch of Hell. By referring to p. 253 of
this volume the reader will observe the influences which caused the
infernal king to be represented as counterpart of the Deity. As this
tradition about Noah&rsquo;s wife is suggestive of a Gnostic origin, it
really looks as if the Devil in it were meant to act the part which the
Gnostics ascribed to Jehovah himself (vol. ii. p. 207). The Devil is
said in rabbinical legends to have seduced the wives of Noah&rsquo;s
sons; this legend seems to show that his aim was to populate the
post-diluvial world entirely with his own progeny, in this being an
Ildabaoth, or degraded edition of Jehovah trying to establish his own
family in the earth by the various means related in vol. i. chap.

<p class="first">I lately heard the story of a pious negro woman whose
faith in hell was sorely tried by a sceptic who asked her how brimstone
enough could be found to burn all the wicked people in the world. After
taking some days for reflection, the old woman, when next challenged by
the sceptic, replied, that she had concluded that &lsquo;every man took
his own brimstone.&rsquo; This humble saint was unconscious that her
instinct had reached the finest thought of Milton, whose Satan says
&lsquo;Myself am hell.&rsquo; Marlowe&rsquo;s Mephistopheles also says,
&lsquo;Where we are is hell.&rsquo; And, far back as the year 633, the
holy man Fursey, who believed himself to have been guided by an angel
near the region of the damned, related a vision much like the view of
the African woman. There were four fires&mdash;Falsehood, Covetousness,
Discord, Injustice&mdash;which joined to form one great flame. When
this drew near, Fursey, in fear, said, &lsquo;Lord, behold the fire
draws near me.&rsquo; The angel answered, &lsquo;That which you did not
kindle shall not burn you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such association of any principle of justice, even in form so crude,
has become rare enough in Christendom to excite applause when it
appears, though the applause has about it that infusion of the
grotesque which one perceives when gallery-gods cheer the actor who
heroically declares that a man ought not to strike a woman. When
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>we go back to the atmosphere of Paganism we find
that retribution had among them a real meaning. Nothing can be in more
remarkable contrast than the disorderly characterless hell of
Christendom, into which the murderer and the man who confuses the
Persons of the Godhead alike burn everlastingly in most inappropriate
fires, and the Hades of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, where every punishment
bears relation to the offence, and is limited in duration to the degree
of the offence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Egyptians,&rsquo; says Herodotus (ii. 123), &lsquo;were
the first who asserted that the soul of man is immortal, and that when
the body perishes it enters into some other animal, constantly
springing into existence; and when it has passed through the different
kinds of terrestrial, marine, and aerial beings, it again enters into
the body of a man that is born, and that this revolution is made in
three thousand years.&rsquo; Probably Plato imported from Egypt his
fancy of the return of one dead to relate the scenes of heaven and
hell, Er the Armenian (Republic, x. 614) suggesting an evolution of
Rhampsinitus (Herod. ii. 122), who descended to Hades alive, played
dice with Ceres, and brought back gold. The vision of Er represents a
terrible hell, indeed, but those punished were chiefly murderers and
tyrants. They are punished tenfold for every wrong they had committed.
But when this punishment is ended, each soul must return to the earth
in such animal form as he or she might select. The animals, too, had
their choice. Er saw that the choice was generally determined by the
previous earthly life,&mdash;many becoming animals because of some
spite derived from their experience. &lsquo;And not only did men pass
into animals, but I must also mention that there were animals tame and
wild who changed into one another, and into corresponding human
natures, the good into the gentle, the evil into the savage,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>in all sorts of combinations.&rsquo; Sly Plato!
Such is his estimate of what men&rsquo;s selections of their paradises
are worth!</p>
<p>Orpheus chose to be a swan, hating to be born of woman, because
women murdered him; Ajax became a lion and Agamemnon an eagle, because
they had suffered injustice from men; Atalanta would be an athlete, and
the jester Thersites a monkey; and Odysseus went about to find the life
of a private gentleman with nothing to do. If Plutarch&rsquo;s friend
Thespesius had pondered well this irony of Plato, he would hardly have
brought back from his visit to Hades the modification that demons were
provided to assign the animal forms in which souls should be born again
on earth. They could hardly have done for the wicked anything worse
than Plato shows them doing for themselves. But the meaning of Plutarch
is the same. Thespesius sees demons preparing the body of a viper for
Nero to be born into, since it was said the young of that reptile
destroy their mother at birth.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Among the Persians the idea of future rewards and punishments
exceeds the exactness of the Koran&mdash;&lsquo;Whoso hath done an atom
of justice shall behold it, and whoso hath done an atom of injustice
shall behold it.&rsquo; The Persian Sufis will even subdivide the soul
rather than that any good act should go down with the larger gross of
wickedness. S&aacute;di tells of a vision where a man was seen in hell,
all except one foot, which was twined with flowers. With all his
wickedness the man had with that foot shoved a bundle of hay within
reach of a weary ox.</p>
<p>But while Persian poets&mdash;Sufis, ennobling the old name
Sophist&mdash;preserved thus a good deal of the universalism of
Parsaism, a Mohammedanism hard as the Scythians who brought it turned
the heart of the people in that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424"
href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>country to stone. In the
Dresden Library there is an illuminated Persian MS., thought to be
seven hundred years old, which has in it what may be regarded as a
portrait of Ahriman and Iblis combined. He is red, has a heavy beard
and moustache, and there is a long dragon&rsquo;s crest and mane on his
head. He wears a green and blue skirt about his loins. His tongue rolls
thirstily between his cruel teeth. He superintends a number of
fish-like devils which float in a lake of fire, and swallow the damned.
Above this scene are the glorified souls, including the Shah sitting
cross-legged on his rug, who look down on the tortures beneath with
evident satisfaction. Apparently this is the only amusement which
relieves the <i>ennui</i> of their heaven.</p>
<p>If anything could make a rational man believe in a fiend-principle
in the universe it would be the suggestion of such pictures, that men
have existed who could conceive of happiness enjoyed in view of such
tortures as these. This and some similar pictures in the East&mdash;for
instance, that in the Temple of Horrors at Wuchang, China&mdash;are
absolutely rayless so far as any touch of humanity is concerned. Are
the Shah and his happy fellow-inspectors of tortures really fiends? In
the light of our present intelligence they may seem so. Certainly no
person of refined feeling could now expect to attain any heaven while
others were in hell. But it <i>would</i> be possible, if persons could
believe that many of those around them are not men and women at all,
but fiends in human shape. These ferocious Hells are referable to a
period when all who incurred the sentences of princes or priests were
seen as mere masks of devils; they were only ascribed human flesh that
they may suffer. The dogma of Hell was doomed from the moment that the
damned were supposed to be really human. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb425" href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span></p>
<p>Were those who killed the martyrs of heresy, for instance, to return
to the world and look upon those whom they pierced, they could never
recognise them. Were they to see the statues of Bruno, Huss, Cranmer,
Servetus, the names and forms would not recall to them the persons they
slew. They would be shocked if told that they had burned great men, and
would surely answer, &lsquo;Men? We burned no men. The Devil came among
us calling himself Huss, and we made short work with him; he reappeared
under several <i>aliases</i>&mdash;Bruno, Servetus, Spinoza, Voltaire:
sometimes we burned him, at other times managed to make him miserable,
thank God! But we were not hurting real men, we were saving
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Around such ideas grew our yet uncivilised Codes of Law. In England,
anno 1878, men are refused as jury-men if they will not say, &lsquo;So
help me God!&rsquo; on the ground that an atheist cannot have a
conscience. Only let him really be without conscience, and call himself
a christian when he is not, and courts receive the selfish liar with
respect. The old clause of the death-sentence&mdash;&lsquo;instigated
thereto by the Devil&rsquo;&mdash;has been dropped in the case of
murderers, however; and that is some gain. Torture by fire of the worst
murderer for one day would not be permitted in Christendom. Belief in
hell-fire outlasts it for a little among the ignorant. But what shall
be said of the educated who profess to believe it?</p>

<p>The Venerable Bede relates that, in the year 696, a Northumbrian
gentleman, who had died in the beginning of the night, came to life and
health in the morning, and gave an account of what he had seen

but adds&mdash;&lsquo;Being thus on all sides enclosed with enemies and

<p>This star rising above all such visions belongs to the vault of the
human Love, and it is visible through all the Ages of Darkness. It
cannot be quenched, and its fiery rays have burnt up mountains of
iniquity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the year 1322,&rsquo; writes Fl&ouml;gel, after the
&lsquo;Chronicon Sampetrinum Erfurtense,&rsquo; &lsquo;there was a play
shown at Eisenach, which had a tragical enough effect. Markgraf
Friedrich of Misnia, Landgraf also of Thuringia, having brought his
tedious warfare to a conclusion, and the country beginning now to
revive under peace, his subjects were busy repaying themselves for the
past distresses by all manner of diversions; to which end, apparently
by the Sovereign&rsquo;s order, a dramatic representation of the <i>Ten
Virgins</i> was schemed, and at Eisenach, in his presence, duly
executed. This happened fifteen days after Easter, by indulgence of the
Preaching Friars. In the &lsquo;Chronicon Sampetrinum&rsquo; stands
recorded that the play was enacted in the Bear Garden (<i lang="la">in
horto ferarum</i>) by the Clergy and their Scholars. But now, when it
came to pass that the Wise Virgins would give the foolish no oil, and
these latter were shut out from the Bridegroom, they began to weep
bitterly, and called on the Saints to intercede for them; who however,
even with Mary at their head, could effect nothing from God; but the
Foolish Virgins were all sentenced to damnation. Which things the
Landgraf seeing and hearing, he fell into a doubt, and was very angry;
and said &lsquo;What then is the Christian Faith, if God will not take
pity on us for intercession of Mary and all the Saints?&rsquo; In this
anger he continued five days; and the learned men could hardly
enlighten him to understand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href=
"#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>the Gospel. Thereupon he was
struck with apoplexy, and became speechless and powerless; in which sad
state he continued, bedrid, two years and seven months, and so died,
being then fifty-five.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In telling the story Carlyle remarks that these &lsquo;Ten Virgins
at Eisenach are more fatal to warlike men than &AElig;schylus&rsquo;
Furies at Athens were to weak women.&rsquo; Even so, until
great-hearted men rose up at Eisenach and elsewhere to begin the work
destined to prove fatal alike to heartless Virgins and Furies. That
star of a warrior&rsquo;s Compassion, hovering over the foolish Friars
and their midnight Gospel, beams far. The story reminds me of an
incident related of a mining district in California, where a rude
theatre was erected, and a company gave, as their first performance,
Othello. When the scene of Desdemona&rsquo;s suffocation approached, a
stalwart miner leaped on the stage, and pulling out his six-shooter,
said to the Moor, &lsquo;You damned nigger! if you touch that woman
I&rsquo;ll blow the top of your head off!&rsquo; A dozen roughs,
clambering over the footlights, cried, &lsquo;Right Joe! we&rsquo;ll
stand by you!&rsquo; The manager met the emergency by crying,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot, boys! This play was wrote by Bill Shakespear;
he&rsquo;s an old Californian, and it&rsquo;s all in fun!&rsquo; Had
this Moor proceeded to roast Desdemona in fire with any verisimilitude,
it is doubtful if the manager could have saved him by an argument
reminding the miners that such was the divine way with sinners in the
region to which most of them were going. The top of that theologic
hell&rsquo;s head is not very safe in these days when human nature is
unchained with all its six-shooters, each liable to be touched off by
fire from that Star revolving in the sphere of Compassion.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Day after day I gazed upon Michael Angelo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Last
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>Judgment&rsquo; in the Sistine Chapel. The
artist was in his sixtieth year when Pope Clement VII. invited him to
cover a wall sixty feet high and nearly as wide with a picture of the
Day of Wrath. In seven years he had finished it. Clement was dead. Pope
Paul IV. looked at it, and liked it not: all he could see was a vast
number of naked figures; so he said it was not fit for the Sistine
Chapel, and must be destroyed. One of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s pupils
saved it by draping some of the figures. Time went on, and another Pope
came who insisted on more drapery,&mdash;so the work was disfigured
again. However, popular ridicule saved this from going very far, and so
there remains the tremendous scene. But Popes and Cardinals always
disliked it. The first impression I received from it was that of a
complete representation of all the physical powers belonging to
organised life; though the forms are human, every animal power is
there, leaping, crouching, crawling,&mdash;every sinew, joint, muscle,
portrayed in completest tension and action. Then the eye wanders from
face to face, and every passion that ever crawled or prowled in jungle
or swamp is pictured. The most unpleasant expressions seemed to me
those of the martyrs. They came up from their graves, each bringing the
instrument by which he had suffered, and offering it in witness against
the poor wretches who came to be judged; and there was a look of
self-righteous satisfaction on their faces as they witnessed the
persecution of their persecutors. As for Christ, he was like a fury,
with hand uplifted against the doomed, his hair wildly floating. The
tortured people below are not in contrast with the blessed above; they
who are in heaven look rather more stupid than the others, and rather
pleased with the anguish they witness, but not more saintly. But
gradually the eye, having wandered over the vast canvas, from the
tortured <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>Cardinal at the bottom up to the furious
Judge,&mdash;alights on a face which, once seen, is never to be
forgotten. Beautiful she is, that Mary beside the Judge, and more
beautiful for the pain that is on her face. She has drawn her drapery
to veil from her sight the anguish below; she has turned her face from
the Judge,&mdash;does not see her son in him; she looks not upon the
blessed,&mdash;for she, the gentle mother, is not in heaven; she cannot
have joy in sight of misery. In that one face of pure womanly
sympathy&mdash;that beauty transfigured in its
compassionateness&mdash;the artist put his soul, his religion.
Mary&rsquo;s face quenches all the painted flames. They are at once
made impossible. The same universe could not produce both a hell and
that horror of it. The furious Jesus is changed to a phantasm; he could
never be born of such a mother. If the Popes had only wished to hide
the nakedness of their own dogmas they ought to have blotted out
Mary&rsquo;s face; for as it now stands the rest of the forms are but
shapes to show how all the wild forms and passions of human animalism
gather as a frame round that which is their consummate
flower,&mdash;the spirit of love enshrined in its perfect human
expression.</p>
<p>So was it that Michael Angelo could not serve two masters. Popes
might employ him, but he could not do the work they liked. &lsquo;The
passive master lent his hand to the vast soul that o&rsquo;er him
planned.&rsquo; He could not help it. The lover of beauty could not
paint the Day of Wrath without setting above it that face like a star
which shines through its unreality, burns up its ugliness, and leaves
the picture a magnificent interpretation of the forms of nature and
hopes of the world,&mdash;a cardinal hypocrite at the bottom, an ideal
woman at the top.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Exhausted by the too-much glory of the visions of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span>Paradise which he had seen, Dante came forth to
the threshold opening on the world of human life, from which he had
parted for a space, and there sank down. As he lay there angels caused
lilies to grow beneath and around him, and myrtle to rise and
intertwine for a bower over him, and their happy voices, wafted in
low-toned hymns, brought soft sleep to his overwrought senses. Long had
he slumbered before the light of familiar day stole once more into
those deep eyes. The angels had departed. The poet awoke to find
himself alone, and with a sigh he said to himself, &lsquo;It is, then,
all but a dream.&rsquo; As he arose he saw before him a man of noble
mien and shining countenance, habited in an Eastern robe, who returned
his gaze with an interest equal to his own. Quickly the eyes of Dante
searched the ground beside the stranger to see if he were shadowless:
convinced thus that he was true flesh and blood, the Florentine thus
addressed him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pilgrim, for such thou seemest, may we meet in simple human
brotherhood? If, as thy garb suggests, thou comest from afar, perchance
the friendly greeting, even of one who in his native city is still
himself a pilgrim, may not be unwelcome.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heart to heart be our kiss, my brother; yet must I journey
without delay to those who watch and wait for wondrous tidings that I
bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Friend! I hear some meaning deeper than thy words. If
&lsquo;twere but as satisfying natural curiosity, answer not; but if
thou bearest a burden of tidings glad for all human-kind, speak! Who
art thou? whence comest, and with what message freighted?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Arda Vir&aacute;f is the name I bear; from Persia have I
come; but by what strange paths have reached this spot know I not, save
that through splendours of worlds invisible to mortal sense I have
journeyed, nor encountered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href=
"#pb431" name="pb431">431</a>]</span>human form till I found thee
slumbering on this spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trebly then art thou my brother! I too have but now, as to my
confused sense it seems, emerged from that vast journey. Thou clearest
from me gathering doubts that those visions were illusive. Yet, as even
things we really see are often overlaid by images that lurk in the eye,
I pray thee tell me something thou hast seen, so that perchance we may
part with mutual confirmation of our vision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That gladly will I do. When the Avesta had been destroyed,
and the sages of Iran disagreed as to the true religion, they agreed
that one should be chosen by lot to drink the sacred draught of
Vishtasp, that he might pass to the invisible world and bring
intelligence therefrom. On me the lot fell. Beside the fire that has
never gone out, surrounded by holy women who chanted our hymns, I drank
the three cups&mdash;Well Thought, Well Said, Well Done. Then as I
slept there rose before me a high stairway of three steps; on the first
was written, Well Thought; on the second, Well Said; on the third, Well
Done. By the first step I reached the realm where good thoughts are
honoured: there were the thinkers whose starlike radiance ever
increased. They offered no prayers, they chanted no liturgies. Above
all was the sphere of the liberal. The next step brought me to the
circle of great and truthful speakers: these walked in lofty splendour.
The third step brought me to the heaven of good actions. I saw the
souls of agriculturists surrounded by spirits of water and earth, trees
and cattle. The artisans were seated on embellished thrones. Sublime
were the seats of teachers, interceders, peace-makers; and the
religious walked in light and joy with which none are satiated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sawest thou the fairest of earth-born ladies&mdash;Beatrice?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name=
"pb432">432</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw indeed a lady most fair. In a pleasant grove lay the
form of a man who had but then parted from earth. When he had awakened,
he walked through the grove and there met him this most beautiful
maiden. To her he said, &lsquo;Who art thou, so fair beyond all whom I
have seen in the land of the living?&rsquo; To him she replied,
&lsquo;O youth, I am thy actions.&rsquo; Can this be thy lady
Beatrice?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But sawest thou no hell? no dire punishments?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas! sad scenes I witnessed, sufferers whose hell was that
their darkness was amid the abodes of splendour. Amid all that glow one
newly risen from earth walked shivering with cold, and there walked
ever by his side a hideous hag. On her he turned and said, &lsquo;Who
art thou, that ever movest beside me, thou that art monstrous beyond
all that I have seen on earth?&rsquo; To him she replied, &lsquo;Man, I
am thy actions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But who were those glorious ones thou sawest in Paradise?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of their names I did indeed learn&mdash;Zoroaster,
Socrates, Plato, Buddha, Confucius, Christ.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do I hear! knowest thou that none of these save that
last holy one&mdash;whom methinks thou namest too lightly among
men&mdash;were baptized? Those have these eyes sorrowfully beheld in
pain through the mysterious justice of God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thinkest thou, then, thy own compassion deeper than the mercy
of Ormuzd? But, ah! now indeed I do remember. As I conversed with the
sages I had named, they related to me this strange event. By guidance
of one of their number, Virgil by name, there had come among them from
the earth a most powerful magician. He bore the name of Dante. By
mighty spells this being had cast them all into a sad circle which he
called Limbo, over whose gate he wrote, though with eyes full of tears,
&lsquo;All <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433</a>]</span>hope abandon, ye who enter here!&rsquo; Thus
were they in great sorrow and dismay. But, presently, as this strange
Dante was about to pass on, so they related, he looked upon the face of
one among them so pure and noble that though he had styled him
&lsquo;pagan,&rsquo; he could not bear to abandon him there. This was
Cato of Utica. Him this Dante led to the door, and gave him liberty on
condition that he would be warder of his unbaptized brethren, and by no
means let any of them escape. No sooner, however, was this done than
this magician beheld others who moved his reverence,&mdash;among them
Trajan and Ripheus,&mdash;and overcome by an impulse of love, he opened
a window in the side of Limbo, bidding them emerge into light. He then
waved his christian wand to close up this aperture, and passed away,
supposing that he had done so; but the limit of that magician&rsquo;s
power had been reached, the window was but veiled, and after he had
gone all these unbaptized ones passed out by that way, and reascended
to the glory they had enjoyed before this Dante had brought his alien
sorceries to bear upon them for a brief space.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can this be true? Is it indeed so that all the sages and
poets of the world are now in equal rank whether or not they have been
sealed as members of Christ?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brother, thy brow is overcast. What! can one so pure and high
of nature as thou desire that the gentle Christ, whom I saw embracing
the sages and prophets of other ages, should turn upon them with hatred
and bind them in gloom and pain like this Dante?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, with a flood of tears, Dante fell at the feet of Arda
Vir&aacute;f, and kissed the hem of his skirt. &lsquo;Purer is thy
vision, O pilgrim, than mine,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I fear that I have
but borne with me to the invisible world the small prejudices of my
little Church, which hath taught me to limit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name="pb434">434</a>]</span>the
Love which I now see to be boundless. Thou who hast learned from thy
Zoroaster that the meaning of God is the end of all evil, a universe
climbing to its flower in joy, deign to take the hand of thy servant
and make him worthy to be thy friend,&mdash;with thee henceforth to
abandon the poor formulas which ignorance substitutes for virtue, and
ascend to the beautiful summits thou has visited by the stairway of
good thoughts, good words, good deeds.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In 1745 Swedenborg was a student of Natural Philosophy in London. In
the April of that year his &lsquo;revelations&rsquo; began amid the
smoke and toil of the great metropolis. &lsquo;I was hungry and ate
with great appetite. Towards the end of the meal I remarked a kind of
mist spread before my eyes, and I saw the floor of my room covered with
hideous reptiles, such as serpents, toads, and the like. I was
astonished, having all my wits about me, being perfectly conscious. The
darkness attained its height and then passed away. I now saw a Man
sitting in the corner of the chamber. As I had thought myself alone, I
was greatly frightened when he said to me, &lsquo;Eat not as
much.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Swedenborg&rsquo;s Diary the incident is related more
particularly. &lsquo;In the middle of the day, at dinner, an Angel
spoke to me, and told me not to eat too much at table. Whilst he was
with me, there plainly appeared to me a kind of vapour steaming from
the pores of my body. It was a most visible watery vapour, and fell
downwards to the ground upon the carpet, where it collected and turned
into divers vermin, which were gathered together under the table, and
in a moment went off with a pop or noise. A fiery light appeared within
them, and a sound was heard, pronouncing that all the vermin that could
possibly be generated by unseemly appetite were thus cast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name="pb435">435</a>]</span>out
of my body, and burnt up, and that I was now cleansed from them. Hence
we may know what luxury and the like have for their bosom
contents.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Continuing the first account Swedenborg said, &lsquo;The following
night the same Man appeared to me again. I was this time not at all
alarmed. The Man said, &lsquo;I am God, the Lord, the Creator, and
Redeemer of the world. I have chosen thee to unfold to men the
spiritual sense of the Holy Scripture. I will myself dictate to thee
what thou shalt write.&rsquo; The same night the world of spirits, hell
and heaven, were convincingly opened to me, where I found many persons
of my acquaintance of all conditions. From that day forth I gave up all
worldly learning, and laboured only in spiritual things, according to
what the Lord commanded me to write.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He &lsquo;gave up all worldly learning,&rsquo; shut his intellectual
eyes, and sank under all the nightmares which his first vision saw
burnt up as vermin. After his fiftieth year, says Emerson, he falls
into jealousy of his intellect, makes war on it, and the violence is
instantly avenged. But the portrait of the blinded mystic as drawn by
the clear seer is too impressive an illustration to be omitted
here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A vampyre sits in the seat of the prophet and turns with
gloomy appetite to the images of pain. Indeed, a bird does not more
readily weave its nest or a mole bore in the ground than this seer of
the souls substructs a new hell and pit, each more abominable than the
last, round every new crew of offenders. He was let down through a
column that seemed of brass, but it was formed of angelic spirits, that
he might descend safely amongst the unhappy, and witness the vastation
of souls; and heard there, for a long continuance, their lamentations;
he saw their tormentors, who increase and strain pangs to infinity; he
saw the hell of the jugglers, the hell of the assassins, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>hell of the lascivious; the hell of robbers, who
kill and boil men; the infernal tun of the deceitful; the
excrementitious hells; the hell of the revengful, whose faces resembled
a round, broad cake, and their arms rotate like a wheel&#8202;&hellip;.
The universe, in his poem, suffers under a magnetic sleep, and only
reflects the mind of the magnetiser&#8202;&hellip;. Swedenborg and
Behmon both failed by attaching themselves to the christian symbol,
instead of to the moral sentiment, which carries innumerable
christianities, humanities, divinities, in its bosom&#8202;&hellip;.
Another dogma, growing out of this pernicious theologic limitation, is
this Inferno. Swedenborg has devils. Evil, according to old
philosophers, is good in the making. That pure malignity can exist, is
the extreme proposition of unbelief&#8202;&hellip;. To what a painful
perversion had Gothic theology arrived, that Swedenborg admitted no
conversion for evil spirits! But the divine effort is never relaxed;
the carrion in the sun will convert itself to grass and flowers; and
man, though in brothels, or jails, or on gibbets, is on his way to all
that is good and true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But even the Hell of Swedenborg is not free from the soft potency of
our star. It is almost painful, indeed, to see its spiritual ray
mingling with the fiery fever-shapes which Swedenborg meets on his way
through the column of brass,&mdash;made, had he known it, not of angels
but of savage scriptures. &lsquo;I gave up all worldly
learning&rsquo;&mdash;he says: but it did not give him up all at once.
&lsquo;They (the damned) suffer ineffable torments; but it was
permitted to relieve or console them with a certain degree of hope, so
that they should not entirely despair. For they said they believed the
torment would be eternal. They were relieved or consoled by saying that
God Messiah is merciful, and that in His Word we read that &lsquo;the
prisoners will be sent forth from the pit&rsquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zech%209:2&amp;version=NRSV">Zech.
ix. 2</a>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>Swedenborg reports that God Messiah appeared to
these spirits, and even embraced and kissed one who had been raised
from &lsquo;the greatest torment.&rsquo; He says, &lsquo;Punishment for
the sake of punishment is the punishment of a devil,&rsquo; and affirms
that all punishment is &lsquo;to take away evils or to induce a faculty
of doing good.&rsquo; These utterances are in his Diary, and were
written before he had got to the bottom of his Calvinistic column; but
even in the &lsquo;Arcana Celestia&rsquo; there is a
gleam:&mdash;&lsquo;Such is the equilibrium of all things in another
life that evil punishes itself, and unless it were removed by
punishments the evil spirits must necessarily be kept in some hell to
eternity.&rsquo;</p>
<p><i>Reductio ad absurdum!</i> And yet Swedenborgians insist upon the
dogma of everlasting punishments; to sustain which they appeal from
Swedenborg half-sober to Swedenborg mentally drunk.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In the Library at Dresden there is a series of old pictures said to
be Mexican, and which I was told had been purchased from a Jew in
Vienna, containing devils mainly of serpent characters blended with
those of humanity. One was a fantastic serpent with human head, sharp
snoutish nose, many eyes, slight wings, and tongue lolling out. Another
had a human head and reptilian tail. A third is human except for the
double tongue darting out. A fourth has issuing from the back of his
head a serpent whose large dragon head is swallowing a human embryo.
Whatever tribe it was that originated these pictures must have had very
strong impressions of the survival of the serpent in some men.</p>
<p>I was reminded of the picture of the serpent swallowing the human
embryo while looking at the wall-pictures in Russian churches
representing the conventional serpent with devils nestling at intervals
along its body, as represented <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb438"
href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span>in our Figure (<a href=
"#fig10">10</a>). Professor Buslaef gave me the right arch&aelig;ology
of this, no doubt, but the devils themselves, as I gazed, seemed to
intimate another theory with their fair forms. They might have been
winged angels but for their hair of flame and cruel hooks. They seemed
to say, &lsquo;We were the ancient embryo-gods of the human
imagination, but the serpent swallowed us. He swallowed us successively
as one after another we availed ourselves of his cunning in our
priesthoods; as we brought his cruel coils to crush those who dared to
outgrow our cult; as we imitated his fang in the deadliness with which
we bit the heel of every advancing thinker; as, when worsted in our
struggle against reason, we took to the double tongue, praising with
one fork the virtues which we poisoned with the other. Now we are
degraded with him for ever, bound to him by these rings, labelled with
the sins we have committed.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It was by a true experience that the ancients so generally took
nocturnal animals to be types of diabolism. Corresponding to them are
the sleepless activities of morally unawakened men. The animal is a
sleeping man. Its passions and instincts are acted out in what to
rational man would be dreams. In dreams, especially when influenced by
disease, a man may mentally relapse very far, and pass through kennels
and styes, which are such even when somewhat decorated by shreds of the
familiar human environment. The nocturnal form of intellect is cunning;
the obscuration of religion is superstition; the dark shadow that falls
on love turns it to lust. These wolves and bats, on which no ideal has
dawned, do not prowl or flit through man in their natural forms: in the
half-awake consciousness, whose starlight attends man amid his
darkness, their misty outlines swell, and in the feverish unenlightened
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href="#pb439" name=
"pb439">439</a>]</span>conscience they become phantasms of his
animalism&mdash;werewolves, vampyres. The awakening of reason in any
animal is through all the phases of cerebral and social evolution. A
wise man said to his son who was afraid to enter the dark, &lsquo;Go
on, child; you will never see anything worse than yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The hare-lip, which we sometimes see in the human face, is there an
arrested development. Every lip is at some embryonic period a hare-lip.
The development of man&rsquo;s visible part has gone on much longer
than his intellectual and moral evolution, and abnormalities in it are
rare in comparison with the number of survivals from the animal world
in his temper, his faith, and his manners. Criminals are men living out
their arrested moral developments. They who regard them as instigated
by a devil are those whose arrest is mental. The eye of reason will
deal with both all the more effectively, because with as little wrath
as a surgeon feels towards the hare-lip he endeavours to humanise.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is an impressive fact that the great and reverent mind of
Spinoza, in pondering the problem of Evil and the theology which
ascribed it to a Devil, was unconsciously led to anticipate by more
than a century the first (modern) scientific suggestions of the
principle of Evolution. In his early treatise, &lsquo;De Deo et
Homine,&rsquo; occurs this short but momentous chapter&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="sc">De Diabolis.</span> If the Devil be an
Entity contrary in all respects to God, having nothing of God in his
nature, there can be nothing in common with God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he assumed to be a thinking Entity, as some will have it,
who never wills and never does any good, and who sets himself in
opposition to God on all occasions, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb440" href="#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span>would assuredly be a
very wretched being, and, could prayers do anything for him, his
amendment were much to be implored.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But let us ask whether so miserable an object could exist
even for an instant; and, the question put, we see at once that it
could not; for from the perfection of a thing proceeds its power of
continuance: the more of the Essential and Divine a thing possesses,
the more enduring it is. But how could the Devil, having no trace of
perfection in him, exist at all? Add to this, that the stability or
duration of a thinking thing depends entirely on its love of and union
with God, and that the opposite of this state in every particular being
presumed in the Devil, it is obviously impossible that there can be any
such being.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then there is indeed no necessity to presume the
existence of a Devil; for the causes of hate, envy, anger, and all such
passions are readily enough to be discovered; and there is no occasion
for resort to fiction to account for the evils they
engender.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the course of his correspondence with the most learned men of his
time, Spinoza was severely questioned concerning his views upon human
wickedness, the disobedience of Adam, and so forth. He said&mdash;to
abridge his answers&mdash;If there be any essential or positive evil in
men, God is the author and continuer of that evil. But what is called
evil in them is their degree of imperfection as compared with those
more perfect. Adam, in the abstract, is a man eating an apple. That is
not in itself an evil action. Acts condemned in man are often admired
in animals,&mdash;as the jealousy of doves,&mdash;and regarded as
evidence of their perfection. Although man must restrain the forces of
nature and direct them to his purposes, it is a superstition to suppose
that God is angry against such forces. It is an error in man to
identify his little inconveniences <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441"
href="#pb441" name="pb441">441</a>]</span>as obstacles to God. Let him
withdraw himself from the consideration and nothing is found evil.
Whatever exists, exists by reason of its perfection for its own
ends,&mdash;which may or may not be those of men.</p>
<p>Spinoza&rsquo;s aphorism, &lsquo;From the perfection of a thing
proceeds its power of continuance,&rsquo; is the earliest modern
statement of the doctrine now called &lsquo;survival of the
fittest.&rsquo; The notion of a Devil involves the solecism of a being

<p>Spinoza was Copernicus of the moral Cosmos. The great German who
discovered to men that their little planet was not the one centre and
single care of nature, led the human mind out of a closet and gave it a
universe. But dogma still clung to the closet; where indeed each sect
still remains, holding its little interest to be the aim of the solar
system, and all outside it to be part of a countless host, marshalled
by a Prince of Evil, whose eternal war is waged against that formidable
pulpiteer whose sermon is sending dismay through pandemonium. But for
rational men all that is ended, and its decline began when Spinoza
warned men against looking at the moral universe from the pin-hole of
their egotism. That closet-creation, whose laws were seen now acting
now suspended to suit the affairs of men, disappeared, and man was led
to adore the All.</p>

<p>It is a small thing that man can bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head, if
its fang still carries its venom so deep in his reason as to blacken
all nature with a sense of triumphant malevolence. To the eye of
judicial man, instructed to decide every case without bribe of his own
interest as a rival animal, the serpent&rsquo;s fang is one of the most
perfect adaptations of means to ends in nature. Were a corresponding
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span>perfection in every human mind, the world would
fulfil the mystical dream of the East, which gave one name to the
serpents that bit them in the wilderness and seraphim singing round the
eternal throne.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;Cursed be the Hebrew who shall either eat pork, or permit his
son to be instructed in the learning of the Greeks.&rsquo; So says the
Talmud, with a voice transmitted from the &lsquo;kingdom of
priests&rsquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exod%2019:6&amp;version=NRSV">Exod.
xix. 6</a>). From the altar of &lsquo;unhewn stone&rsquo; came the
curse upon Art, and upon the race that represented culture raising its
tool upon the rudeness of nature. That curse of the Talmud recoiled
fearfully. The Jewish priesthood had their son in Peter with his vision
of clean and unclean animals, and the command, &lsquo;Slay and
eat!&rsquo; Uninstructed is this heir of priestly Judaism &lsquo;in the
learning of the Greeks,&rsquo; consequently his way of converting
Gentiles&mdash;the herd of swine, the <i>goyim</i>&mdash;is to convert
them into christian protoplasm. &lsquo;Slay and eat,&rsquo; became the
cry of the elect, and their first victim was the paternal Jew who
taught them that pork and Greek learning belonged to the same
category.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>But there was another Jewish nation not composed of priests. While
the priestly kingdom is typified in Jonah announcing the destruction of
Nineveh, who, because the great city still goes on, reproaches Jehovah,
the nation of the poets has now its Jehovah II. who sees the
humiliation of the tribal priesthood as a withered gourd compared with
the arts, wealth, and human interests of a Gentile city. &lsquo;The
Lord repented.&rsquo; The first Gospel to the Gentiles is in that
gentle thought for the uncircumcised Ninevites. But it was reached too
late. When it gained expression in Christ welcoming Greeks, and seeing
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>stones possible &lsquo;children of
Abraham;&rsquo; in Paul acknowledging debt to barbarians and taking his
texts from Greek altars or poets; the evolution of the ideal element in
Hebrew religion had gained much. But historic combinations raised the
judaisers to a throne, and all the narrowness of their priesthood was
re-enacted as Christianity.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The column of brass in whose hollow centre the fine brain of
Swedenborg was imprisoned is a fit similitude of the christian formula.
The whole moral attitude of Christianity towards nature is represented
in his first vision. The beginning of his spiritual career is announced
by the evaporation of his animal nature in the form of vermin. The
christian hell is present, and these <span class="corr" id="xd26e7980"
title="Source: aminal">animal</span> parts are burnt up. Among those
burnt-up powers of Swedenborg, one of the serpents must have been his
intellect. &lsquo;From that day forth I gave up all worldly
learning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here we have the ideal christian caught up to his paradise even
while his outward shape is visible. But what if we were all to become
like that? Suppose all the animal powers and desires were to evaporate
out of mankind and to be burnt up! Were that to occur to-day the effect
on the morrow would be but faintly told in that which would be caused
by sudden evaporations of steam from all the engines of the world. We
may imagine a band of philanthropists, sorely disturbed by the number
of accidents incidental to steam-locomotion, who should conspire to go
at daybreak to all the engine-houses and stations in England, and, just
as the engines were about to start for their work, should quench their
fires, let off their steam, and break their works. That would be but a
brief paralysis of the work of one country; but what would be the
result if the animal nature of man and its desires, the works and
trades that minister to the &lsquo;pomps <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb444" href="#pb444" name="pb444">444</a>]</span>and vanities,&rsquo;
all worldly aims and joys, should be burnt up in fires of
fanaticism!</p>
<p>Yet to that fatal aim Christianity gave itself,&mdash;so contrary to
that great heart in which was mirrored the beautiful world, its lilies
and little children, and where love shed its beams on the just and the
unjust! The organising principle of Christianity was that which
crucified Jesus and took his tomb for corner-stone of a system modelled
after what he hated. Its central purpose was to effect a divorce
between the moral and the animal nature of man. One is called flesh and
the other spirit; one was the child of God, the other the child of the
Devil. It rent asunder that which was really one; its whole history, so
long as it was in earnest, was the fanatical effort to keep asunder by
violence those two halves ever seeking harmony; its history since its
falsity was exposed has been the hypocrisy of professing in word what
is impossible in deed.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Beside the christian vision of Swedenborg, in which the judaic
priest&rsquo;s curse on swinish Greek learning found apotheosis, let us
set the vision of a Jewish seer in whom the humanity that spared
Nineveh found expression. The seer is Philo,&mdash;name rightly
belonging to that pure mind in which the starry ideals of his Semitic
race embraced the sensuous beauty which alone could give them life.
Philo (Pr&aelig;m. et P&oelig;nis, sec. 15&ndash;20) describes as the
first joy of the redeemed earth the termination of the war between man
and animal. That war will end, he says, &lsquo;when the wild beasts in
the soul have been tamed. Then the most ferocious animals will submit
to man; scorpions will lose their stings, and serpents their poison.
And, in consequence of the suppression of that older war between man
and beast, the war between man and man shall also end.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=

<p>Here we emerge from Swedenborg&rsquo;s brass column, we pass beyond
Peter&rsquo;s sword called &lsquo;Slay-and-eat,&rsquo; we leave behind
the Talmud&rsquo;s curse on swine and learning: we rise to the clear
vision of Hebrew prophecy which beheld lion and lamb lying down
together, a child leading the wild forces subdued by culture.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;Why not God kill Debbil?&rsquo; asked Man Friday. It is a
question which not even Psychology has answered, why no Theology has
yet suggested the death of the Devil in the past, or prophesied more
than chains for him in the future. No doubt the need of a
&lsquo;hangman&rsquo;s whip to haud the wretch in order&rsquo; may
partly account for it; but with this may have combined a cause of which
it is pleasanter to think&mdash;Devils being animal passions in excess,
even the ascetic recoils from their destruction, with an instinct like
that which restrains rats from gnawing holes through the ship&rsquo;s
bottom.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; we read, <i lang="de">Doch das
Antike find&rsquo; ich zu lebendig</i>. It is a criticism on the nudity
of the Greek forms that appear in the classical Walpurgis Night. But
the authority is not good: it is Mephistopheles who is disgusted with
sight of the human form, and he says they ought in modern fashion to be
plastered over. His sentiments have prevailed at the Vatican, where the
antique statues and the great pictures of Michael Angelo bear witness
to the prurient prudery of the papal mind. &lsquo;Devils are our

<hr class="tb">
<p>Herodotus (ii. 47) says, &lsquo;The Egyptians consider the pig to be
an impure beast, and therefore if a man, in passing by a pig, should
touch him only with his garments, he forthwith goes to the river and
plunges in; and, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href=
"#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span>next place, swineherds, although
native Egyptians, are the only men who are not allowed to enter any of
their temples.&rsquo; The Egyptians, he says, do not sacrifice the
goat; &lsquo;and, indeed, their painters and sculptors represent Pan
with the face and legs of a goat, as the Grecians do; not that they
imagine this to be his real form, for they think him like other gods;
but why they represent him in this way I had rather not mention.&rsquo;
We need not feel the same prudery. The Egyptians rightly regarded the
symbol of sexual desire, on whose healthy exercise the perpetuation of
life depended, as a very different kind of animalism from that
symbolised in the pig&rsquo;s love of refuse and garbage. Their
association of the goat with Pan&mdash;the lusty vigour of
nature&mdash;was the natural preface to the arts of Greece in which the
wild forces were taught their first lesson&mdash;Temperance. Pan
becomes musical. The vigour and vitality of human nature find in the
full but not excessive proportions of Apollo, Aphrodite, Artemis, and
others of the bright array, the harmony which Pan with his pipe
preludes. The Greek statue is soul embodied and body ensouled.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Two men had I the happiness to know in my youth, into whose faces I
looked up and saw the throne of Genius illumined by Purity. One of
them, Ralph Waldo Emerson, wrote, &lsquo;If beauty, softness, and faith
in female forms have their own influence, vices even, in a slight
degree, are thought to improve the expression.&rsquo; The other, Arthur
Hugh Clough, wrote, &lsquo;What we all love is good touched up with
evil.&rsquo; Here are two brave flowers, of which one grew out of the
thorny stem of Puritanism, the other from the monastic root of Oxford.
The &lsquo;vices&rsquo; which could improve the expression, even for
the pure eyes of Emerson, are those which represent the struggle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name=
"pb447">447</a>]</span>of human nature to exist in truth, albeit in
misdirection and reaction, amid pious hypocrisies. The Oxonian scholar
had seen enough of the conventionalised characterless
&lsquo;good&rsquo; to long for some sign of life and freedom, even
though it must come as a touch of &lsquo;evil.&rsquo; To the artist,
nature is never seen in petrifaction; it is really as well as literally
<i>a becoming</i>. The evil he sees is &lsquo;good in the
making:&rsquo; what others call vices are voices in the wilderness
preparing the way of the highest.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>&lsquo;God and the Devil make the whole of Religion,&rsquo; said
Nicoli&mdash;speaking, perhaps, better than he knew. The culture of the
world has shown that the sometime opposed realms of human interest, so
personified, are equally essential. It is through this experience that
the Devil has gained such ample vindication from the poets&mdash;as in
Rapisardi&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lucifero,&rsquo; a veritable &lsquo;bringer of
Light,&rsquo; and Cranch&rsquo;s &lsquo;Satan.&rsquo; From the latter
work (&lsquo;Satan: A Libretto.&rsquo; Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1874),
which should be more widely known, I quote some lines. Satan
says&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e3866">I symbolise the wild and deep</p>
<p class="line">And unregenerated wastes of life,</p>
<p class="line">Dark with transmitted tendencies of race</p>

<p class="line">And tendency unbalanced by due weight</p>
<p class="line">Of favouring circumstance; all passion blown</p>

<p>To evoke Helena, Faust, as we have seen, must repair to the
<span class="sc">Mothers</span>. But who may these be? They shine
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=

tints one cannot transfix their sense. They seemed to me just now the
primal conditions, by fulfilling which anything might be attained,
without which, nothing. But now (yet perhaps the difference is not
great) I see the Mothers to be the ancient healthy instincts and ideals
of our race. These took shape in forms of art, whose evolution had been
man&rsquo;s harmony with himself. Christianity, borrowing thunder of
one god, hammer of another, shattered them&mdash;shattered our Mothers!
And now learned travellers go about in many lands saying, &lsquo;Saw ye
my beloved?&rsquo; Amid cities ruined and buried we are trying to
recover them, fitting limb to limb&mdash;so carefully! as if
half-conscious that we are piecing together again the fragments of our
own humanity.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Devil: <i>Does he Exist, and what does he Do?</i>&rsquo;
Such is the title of a recent work by Father Delaporte, Professor of
Dogma in the Faculty of Bordeaux. He gives specific directions for
exorcism of devils by means of holy water, the sign of the cross, and
other charms. &lsquo;These measures,&rsquo; says one of his American
critics, &lsquo;may answer very well against the French Devil; but our
American Beelzebub is a potentate that goeth not forth on any such
hints.&rsquo; Father Delaporte would hardly contend that the use of
cross and holy water for a thousand years has been effectual in
dislodging the European Beelzebub.</p>
<p>On the whole, I am inclined to prefer the method of the Africans of
the Guinea Coast. They believe in a particularly hideous devil, but say
that the only defence they require against him is a mirror. If any one
will keep a mirror beside him, the Devil must see himself in it, and he
at once rushes away in terror of his own ugliness. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href="#pb449" name="pb449">449</a>]</span></p>
<p>No monster ever conjured up by imagination is more hideous than a
rational being transformed to a beast. Just that is every human being
who has brought his nobler powers down to be slaves of his animal
nature. No eye could look upon that fearful sight unmoved. All man
needs is a true mirror in which his own animalism may see itself. We
cannot borrow for this purpose the arts of Greece, nor the fairy ideals
of Germany, nor the emasculated saints of Christendom. These were but
fragments of the man who has been created by combination of their
powers, and their several ideals are broken bits that cannot reflect
the whole being of man in its proportions or disproportions.</p>
<p>The higher nature of man, polished by culture of all his faculties,
can alone be the faithful mirror before his lower. The clearness of
this mirror in the individual heart depends mainly on the civilisation
and knowledge surrounding it. The discovered law turns once plausible
theories to falsehoods; a noble literature transmutes once popular
books to trash. When Art interprets the realities of nature, when it
shows how much beauty and purity our human nature is capable of, it
holds a mirror before all deformities. At a theatre in the city of
London, I witnessed the performance of an actor who, in the course of
his part, struck a child. He was complimented by a hurricane of hisses
from the crowded gallery. Had those &lsquo;gods&rsquo; up there never
struck children? Possibly. Yet here each had a mirror before him and
recoiled from his worst self. A clergyman relates that, while looking
at pictures in the Bethnal Green Museum, he overheard a poor woman, who
had been gazing on a Madonna, say, &lsquo;If I had such a child as that
I believe I could be a good woman.&rsquo; Who can say what even that
one glance at her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450"
name="pb450">450</a>]</span>life in the ideal reflector may be worth to
that wanderer amid the miseries and temptations of London!</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It is not easy for those who have seen what is high and holy to give
their hearts to what is base and unholy. It is as natural for human
nature to love virtue as to love any other beauty. External beauty is
visible to all, and all desire it: the interior beauty is not visible
to superficial glances, but the admiration shown even for its
counterfeits shows how natural it is to admire virtue. But in order
that the charm of this moral beauty may be felt by human nature it must
be related to that nature&mdash;real. It must not be some childish
ideal which answers to no need of the man of to-day; not something
imported from a time and place where it had meaning and force to others
where it has none.</p>
<p>When dogmas surviving from the primitive world are brought to behold
themselves in the mirror held up by Science, they cry out, &lsquo;That
is not my face! You are caricaturing my beliefs!&rsquo; This recoil of
Superstition from its own ugliness is the victory of Religion. What
priests bewail as disbelief is faith fleeing from its deformities.
Ignorant devotion proves its need of Science by its terrors of the
same, which are like those of the horse at first sight of its best
friend, bearer of its burthens&mdash;the locomotive.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Religion, like every other high feature of human nature, has its
animal counterpart. The animalised religion is superstition. It has
various expressions,&mdash;the abjectness of one form, the ferocity of
another, the cunning of a third. It is unconscious of anything higher
than animalism. Its god is a very great animal preying on other
animals, which are laid on his altars; or pleased when smaller animals
give up their part of the earthly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451"
href="#pb451" name="pb451">451</a>]</span>feast by starving their
passions and senses. Under the growth of civilisation and intelligence
that pious asceticism is revealed in its true form,&mdash;intensified
animalism. The asceticism of one age becomes the self-indulgence of
another. The two-footed animal having discovered that his god does not
eat the meat left for him, eats it himself. Learning that he gets as
much from his god by a wafer and a prayer, he offers these and retains
the gifts, treasures, and pleasures so commuted,&mdash;these, however,
being withdrawn from the direction of the higher nature by the fact of
being obtained through the conditions of the lower, and dependent on
their persistence. In process of time the forms and formulas of
religion, detached from all reality&mdash;such as no conceivable
monarch could desire&mdash;not only become senseless, but depend upon
their senselessness for continuance. They refuse to come at all within
the domain of reason or common-sense, and trust to mental torpor of the
masses, force of habit in the aggregate, self-interest in the wealthy
and powerful, bribes for thinkers and scholars.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Animalism disguised as a religion must render the human religion,
able to raise passions into divine attributes of a perfect manhood,
impossible so long as it continues. That a human religion can ever come
by any process of evolution from a superstition which can only exist by
ministry to the baser motives is a delusion. The only hope of society
is that its independent minds may gain culture, and so surround this
unextinct monster with mirrors that it may perish through shame at its
manifold deformities. These are symbolised in the many-headed phantasm
which is the subject of this work. Demon, Dragon, and Devil have long
paralysed the finest powers of man, peopling nature with horrors, the
heart <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452</a>]</span>with fears, and causing the religious sentiment
itself to make actual in history the worst excesses it professed to
combat in its imaginary adversaries. My largest hope is that from the
dragon-guarded well where Truth is too much concealed she may emerge
far enough to bring her mirror before these phantoms of fear, and with
far-darting beams send them back to their caves in Chaos and ancient
Night.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The battlements of the cloisters of Magdalen College, Oxford, are
crowned with an array of figures representing virtues and vices, with
carved allegories of teaching and learning. Under the Governor&rsquo;s
window are the pelican feeding its young from its breast, and the lion,
denoting the tenderness and the strength of a Master of youth. There
follow the professions&mdash;the lawyer embracing his client, the
physician with his bottle, the divine as Moses with his tables of the
Law. Next are the slayers of Goliath and other mythical enemies. We
come to more real, albeit monstrous, enemies; to Gluttony in
ecclesiastical dress, with tongue lolling out; and low-browed Luxury
without any vesture, with a wide-mouthed animal-eared face on its
belly, the same tongue lolling out&mdash;as in our figures of Typhon
and Kali. Drunkenness has three animal heads&mdash;one of a degraded
humanity, another a sheep, the third a goose. Cruelty is a werewolf; a
frog-faced Lamia represents its mixture with Lust; and other vices are
represented by other monsters, chiefly dragons with griffin forms,
until the last is reached&mdash;the Devil, who is just opposite the
Governor&rsquo;s symbols across the quadrangle.</p>
<p>So was represented, some centuries ago, the conflict of Ormuzd and
Ahriman, for the young soldiers who enlisted at Oxford for that
struggle. A certain amount of fancy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb453" href="#pb453" name="pb453">453</a>]</span>has entered into the
execution of the figures; but, if this be carefully detached, the
history which I have attempted to tell in these volumes may be
generally traced in the Magdalen statues. Each represents some phase in
the advance of the world, when, under new emergencies, earlier symbols
were modified, recombined, and presently replaced by new shapes. It was
found inadequate to keep the scholar throwing stones at the mummy of
Goliath when by his side was living Gluttony in religious garb. The
scriptural symbols are gradually mixed with those of Greek and German
mythology, and by such contact with nature are able to generate forms,
whose lolling tongues, wide mouths, and other expressions, represent
with some realism the physiognomies of brutality let loose through
admission to human shape and power.</p>
<p>It may be that, when they were set up, the young Oxonian passed
shuddering these terrible forms, dreaded these werewolves and
succub&aelig;, and dreamed of going forth to impale dragons. But now
the sculptures excite only laughter or curiosity, when they are not
passed by without notice. Yet the old conflict between Light and
Darkness has not ceased. The ancient forms of it pass away; they become
grotesque. Such was necessarily the case where the excessive
mythological and fanciful elements introduced at one period fall upon
another period when they hide the meaning. Their obscurity, even for
antiquarians, marks how far away from those cold battlefields the
struggle they symbolised has passed. But it ceases not. Some scholars
who listen to the sweet vespers of Magdalen may think the conflict
over; if so, even poor brother Moody may enter the true kingdom before
them; for, when preaching in Baltimore last September, he said,
&lsquo;Men are possessed of devils just as much now as they ever were.
The devil of rum is as great as any that ever <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href="#pb454" name=
"pb454">454</a>]</span>lived. Why cannot this one and all others be
cast out? Because there is sin in the christian camp.&rsquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The picture which closes this volume has been made for me by the
artist Hennessey, to record an incident which occurred at the door of
N&ocirc;tre Dame in Paris last summer. I had been examining an ugly
devil there treading down human forms into hell; but a dear friend
looked higher, and saw a bird brooding over its young on a nest
supported by that same horrible head.</p>
<p>So, above the symbols of wrath in nature, Love still interweaves
heavenly tints with the mystery of life; beside the horns of pain
prepares melodies.</p>
<p>Even so, also, over the animalism which deforms man, rises the
animal perfection which shames that; here ascending above the reign of
violence by a feather&rsquo;s force, and securing to that little
creature a tenderness that could best express the heart of a Christ,
when it would gather humanity under his wings.</p>
<p>This same little scene at the cathedral door came before me again as
I saw the Oxonian youth, with their morning-faces, passing so
heedlessly those ancient sculptures at Magdalen. Over every happy heart
the same old love was brooding, in each nestling faculties were trying
to gain their wings. To what will they aspire, those students moving so
light-hearted amid the dead dragons and satans of an extinct world? Do
they think there are no more dragons to be slain? Know they that
saying, &lsquo;He descended into hell;&rsquo; and that, from Orpheus
and Herakles to Mohammed and Swedenborg, this is the burthen felt by
those who would be saviours of men?</p>
<p>It is not only loving birds that build their nests and rear their
young over the horns of forgotten fears, but, alas! the Harpies too!
These, which Dante saw nestling in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455"
href="#pb455" name="pb455">455</a>]</span>still plants&mdash;once men
who had wronged themselves&mdash;rear successors above the aspirations
that have ended in &lsquo;nothing but leaves.&rsquo; The sculptures of
Magdalen are incomplete. There is a vacant side to the quadrangle,
which, it is to be feared, awaits the truer teaching that would fill it
up with the real dragons which no youth could heedlessly pass. Who can
carve there the wrongs that await their powers of redress? Who can set
before them, with all its baseness, the true emblem of pious fraud?
When will they see in any stone mirror the real shape of a
double-tongued Culture&mdash;one fork intoning litanies, another
whispering contempt of them? The werewolves of scholarly selfishness,
the Lamias of christian casuistry, the subtle intelligence that is fed
by sages and heroes, but turns them to dust, nay, to venom, because it
dares not be human, still crawls&mdash;these are yet to be revealed in
all their horrors. Then will the old cry, <span class="sc">Sursum
Corda</span>, sound over the ancient symbols whereon scholars waste
their strength, by which they are conquered; and wings of courage shall
bear them with their arrows of light to rescue from Superstition the
holy places of Humanity.</p>
