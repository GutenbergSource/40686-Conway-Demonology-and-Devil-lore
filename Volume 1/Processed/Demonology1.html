<p class="first">Three Friars, says a legend, hid themselves near the
Witch Sabbath orgies that they might count the devils; but the Chief of
these, discovering the friars, said&mdash;&lsquo;Reverend Brothers, our
army is such that if all the Alps, their rocks and glaciers, were
equally divided among us, none would have a pound&rsquo;s
weight.&rsquo; This was in one Alpine valley. Any one who has caught
but a glimpse of the world&rsquo;s Walpurgis Night, as revealed in
Mythology and Folklore, must agree that this courteous devil did not
overstate the case. Any attempt to catalogue the evil spectres which
have haunted mankind were like trying to count the shadows cast upon
the earth by the rising sun. This conviction has grown upon the author
of this work at every step in his studies of the subject.</p>
<p>In 1859 I contributed, as one of the American &lsquo;Tracts for the
Times,&rsquo; a pamphlet entitled &lsquo;The Natural History of the
Devil.&rsquo; Probably the chief value of that essay was to myself, and
this in that its preparation had revealed to me how pregnant with
interest and importance was the subject selected. Subsequent researches
in the same direction, after I had come to reside in Europe, revealed
how slight had been my conception of the vastness of the domain upon
which that early venture was made. In 1872, while preparing a series of
lectures for the Royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e209" href=
"#xd26e209" name="xd26e209">vi</a>]</span>Institution on Demonology, it
appeared to me that the best I could do was to print those lectures
with some notes and additions; but after they were delivered there
still remained with me unused the greater part of materials collected
in many countries, and the phantasmal creatures which I had evoked
would not permit me to rest from my labours until I had dealt with them
more thoroughly.</p>
<p>The fable of Thor&rsquo;s attempt to drink up a small spring, and
his failure because it was fed by the ocean, seems aimed at such
efforts as mine. But there is another aspect of the case which has
yielded me more encouragement. These phantom hosts, however
unmanageable as to number, when closely examined, present comparatively
few types; they coalesce by hundreds; from being at first overwhelmed
by their multiplicity, the classifier finds himself at length beating
bushes to start a new variety. Around some single form&mdash;the
physiognomy, it may be, of Hunger or Disease, of Lust or
Cruelty&mdash;ignorant imagination has broken up nature into
innumerable bits which, like mirrors of various surface, reflect the
same in endless sizes and distortions; but they vanish if that central
fact be withdrawn.</p>
<p>In trying to conquer, as it were, these imaginary monsters, they
have sometimes swarmed and gibbered around me in a mad comedy which
travestied their tragic sway over those who believed in their reality.
Gargoyles extended their grin over the finest architecture, cornices
coiled to serpents, the very words of speakers started out of their
conventional sense into images that tripped my attention. Only as what
I believed right solutions were given to their problems were my
sphinxes laid; but through this psychological experience it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e215" href="#xd26e215" name=
"xd26e215">vii</a>]</span>appeared that when one was so laid his or her
legion disappeared also. Long ago such phantasms ceased to haunt my
nerves, because I discovered their unreality; I am now venturing to
believe that their mythologic forms cease to haunt my studies, because
I have found out their reality.</p>
<p>Why slay the slain? Such may be the question that will arise in the
minds of many who see this book. A Scotch song says, &lsquo;The Devil
is dead, and buried at Kirkcaldy;&rsquo; if so, he did not die until he
had created a world in his image. The natural world is overlaid by an
unnatural religion, breeding bitterness around simplest thoughts,
obstructions to science, estrangements not more reasonable than if they
resulted from varying notions of lunar figures,&mdash;all derived from
the Devil-bequeathed dogma that certain beliefs and disbeliefs are of
infernal instigation. Dogmas moulded in a fossil demonology make the
foundation of institutions which divert wealth, learning, enterprise,
to fictitious ends. It has not, therefore, been mere intellectual
curiosity which has kept me working at this subject these many years,
but an increasing conviction that the sequel&aelig; of such
superstitions are exercising a still formidable influence. When Father
Delaporte lately published his book on the Devil, his Bishop
wrote&mdash;&lsquo;Reverend Father, if every one busied himself with
the Devil as you do, the kingdom of God would gain by it.&rsquo;
Identifying the kingdom here spoken of as that of Truth, it has been
with a certain concurrence in the Bishop&rsquo;s sentiment that I have
busied myself with the work now given to the public. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A college in the State of Ohio has adopted for its
motto the words &lsquo;Orient thyself.&rsquo; This significant
admonition to Western youth represents one condition of attaining truth
in the science of mythology. Through neglect of it the glowing
personifications and metaphors of the East have too generally migrated
to the West only to find it a Medusa turning them to stone. Our prosaic
literalism changes their ideals to idols. The time has come when we
must learn rather to see ourselves in them: out of an age and
civilisation where we live in habitual recognition of natural forces we
may transport ourselves to a period and region where no sophisticated
eye looks upon nature. The sun is a chariot drawn by shining steeds and
driven by a refulgent deity; the stars ascend and move by arbitrary
power or command; the tree is the bower of a spirit; the fountain leaps
from the urn of a naiad. In such gay costumes did the laws of nature
hold <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>their carnival until Science struck the hour for
unmasking. The costumes and masks have with us become materials for
studying the history of the human mind, but to know them we must
translate our senses back into that phase of our own early existence,
so far as is consistent with carrying our culture with us.</p>
<p>Without conceding too much to Solar mythology, it may be pronounced
tolerably clear that the earliest emotion of worship was born out of
the wonder with which man looked up to the heavens above him. The
splendours of the morning and evening; the azure vault, painted with
frescoes of cloud or blackened by the storm; the night, crowned with
constellations: these awakened imagination, inspired awe, kindled
admiration, and at length adoration, in the being who had reached
intervals in which his eye was lifted above the earth. Amid the rapture
of Vedic hymns to these sublimities we meet sharp questionings whether
there be any such gods as the priests say, and suspicion is sometimes
cast on sacrifices. The forms that peopled the celestial spaces may
have been those of ancestors, kings, and great men, but anterior to all
forms was the poetic enthusiasm which built heavenly mansions for them;
and the crude cosmogonies of primitive science were probably caught up
by this spirit, and consecrated as slowly as scientific generalisations
now are.</p>
<p>Our modern ideas of evolution might suggest the reverse of
this&mdash;that human worship began with things low and gradually
ascended to high objects; that from rude ages, in which adoration was
directed to stock and stone, tree and reptile, the human mind climbed
by degrees to the contemplation and reverence of celestial grandeurs.
But the accord of this view with our ideas of evolution is apparent
only. The real progress seems here to have been from the far to the
near, from the great to the small. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb3" href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>is, indeed, probably inexact
to speak of the worship of stock and stone, weed and wort, insect and
reptile, as primitive. There are many indications that such things were
by no race considered intrinsically sacred, nor were they really
worshipped until the origin of their sanctity was lost; and even now,
ages after their oracular or symbolical character has been forgotten,
the superstitions that have survived in connection with such
insignificant objects point to an original association with the
phenomena of the heavens. No religions could, at first glance, seem
wider apart than the worship of the serpent and that of the glorious
sun; yet many ancient temples are covered with symbols combining sun
and snake, and no form is more familiar in Egypt than the solar serpent
standing erect upon its tail, with rays around its head.</p>
<p>Nor is this high relationship of the adored reptile found only in
regions where it might have been raised up by ethnical combinations as
the mere survival of a savage symbol. William Craft, an African who
resided for some time in the kingdom of Dahomey, informed me of the
following incident which he had witnessed there. The sacred serpents
are kept in a grand house, which they sometimes leave to crawl in their
neighbouring grounds. One day a negro from some distant region
encountered one of these animals and killed it. The people learning
that one of their gods had been slain, seized the stranger, and having
surrounded him with a circle of brushwood, set it on fire. The poor
wretch broke through the circle of fire and ran, pursued by the crowd,
who struck him with heavy sticks. Smarting from the flames and blows,
he rushed into a river; but no sooner had he entered there than the
pursuit ceased, and he was told that, having gone through fire and
water, he was purified, and might emerge with safety. Thus, even in
that distant and savage <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4"
name="pb4">4</a>]</span>region, serpent-worship was associated with
fire-worship and river-worship, which have a wide representation in
both Aryan and Semitic symbolism. To this day the orthodox Israelites
set beside their dead, before burial, the lighted candle and a basin of
pure water. These have been associated in rabbinical mythology with the
angels Michael (genius of Water) and Gabriel (genius of Fire); but they
refer both to the phenomenal glories and the purifying effects of the
two elements as reverenced by the Africans in one direction and the
Parsees in another.</p>
<p>Not less significant are the facts which were attested at the
witch-trials. It was shown that for their pretended divinations they
used plants&mdash;as rue and vervain&mdash;well known in the ancient
Northern religions, and often recognised as examples of tree-worship;
but it also appeared that around the cauldron a mock zodiacal circle
was drawn, and that every herb employed was alleged to have derived its
potency from having been gathered at a certain hour of the night or
day, a particular quarter of the moon, or from some spot where sun or
moon did or did not shine upon it. Ancient planet-worship is, indeed,
still reflected in the habit of village herbalists, who gather their
simples at certain phases of the moon, or at certain of those holy
periods of the year which conform more or less to the pre-christian
festivals.</p>
<p>These are a few out of many indications that the small and senseless
things which have become almost or quite fetishes were by no means such
at first, but were mystically connected with the heavenly elements and
splendours, like the animal forms in the zodiac. In one of the earliest
hymns of the Rig-Veda it is said&mdash;&lsquo;This earth belongs to
Varuna (<span class="trans" title="Ouranos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Omicron;&#8016;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&#8057;&sigmaf;</span></span>)
the king, and the wide sky: he is contained also in this drop of
water.&rsquo; As the sky was seen reflected in the shining curve of a
dew-drop, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>even so in the shape or colour of a leaf or flower,
the transformation of a chrysalis, or the burial and resurrection of a
scarab&aelig;us&rsquo; egg, some sign could be detected making it
answer in place of the typical image which could not yet be painted or
carved.</p>
<p>The necessities of expression would, of course, operate to invest
the primitive conceptions and interpretations of celestial phenomena
with those pictorial images drawn from earthly objects of which the
early languages are chiefly composed. In many cases that are met in the
most ancient hymns, the designations of exalted objects are so little
descriptive of them, that we may refer them to a period anterior to the
formation of that refined and complex symbolism by which primitive
religions have acquired a representation in definite characters. The
Vedic comparisons of the various colours of the dawn to horses, or the
rain-clouds to cows, denotes a much less mature development of thought
than the fine observation implied in the connection of the forked
lightning with the forked serpent-tongue and forked mistletoe, or
symbolisation of the universe in the concentric folds of an onion. It
is the presence of these more mystical and complex ideas in religions
which indicate a progress of the human mind from the large and obvious
to the more delicate and occult, and the growth of the higher vision
which can see small things in their large relationships. Although the
exaltation in the Vedas of Varuna as king of heaven, and as contained
also in a drop of water, is in one verse, we may well recognise an
immense distance in time between the two ideas there embodied. The
first represents that primitive pantheism which is the counterpart of
ignorance. An unclassified outward universe is the reflection of a mind
without form and void: it is while all within is as yet
undiscriminating wonder that the religious vesture of nature will be
this undefined pantheism. The fruit of the tree of the knowledge
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>of good and evil has not yet been tasted. In some of
the earlier hymns of the Rig-Veda, the Maruts, the storm-deities, are
praised along with Indra, the sun; Yama, king of Death, is equally
adored with the goddess of Dawn. &lsquo;No real foe of yours is known
in heaven, nor in earth.&rsquo; &lsquo;The storms are thy
allies.&rsquo; Such is the high optimism of sentences found even in
sacred books which elsewhere mask the dawn of the Dualism which
ultimately superseded the harmony of the elemental Powers. &lsquo;I
create light and I create darkness, I create good and I create
evil.&rsquo; &lsquo;Look unto Yezdan, who causeth the shadow to
fall.&rsquo; But it is easy to see what must be the result when this
happy family of sun-god and storm-god and fire-god, and their
innumerable co-ordinate divinities, shall be divided by discord. When
each shall have become associated with some earthly object or fact, he
or she will appear as friend or foe, and their connection with the
sources of human pleasure and pain will be reflected in collisions and
wars in the heavens. The rebel clouds will be transformed to Titans and
Dragons. The adored Maruts will be no longer storm-heroes with
unsheathed swords of lightning, marching as the retinue of Indra, but
fire-breathing monsters&mdash;Vritras and Ahis,&mdash;and the morning
and evening shadows from faithful watch-dogs become the treacherous
hell-hounds, like Orthros and Cerberus. The vehement antagonisms
between animals and men and of tribe against tribe, will be expressed
in the conception of struggles among gods, who will thus be classified
as good or evil deities.</p>
<p>This was precisely what did occur. The primitive pantheism was
broken up: in its place the later ages beheld the universe as the arena
of a tremendous conflict between good and evil Powers, who severally,
in the process of time, marshalled each and everything, from a world to
a worm, under their flaming banners. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7"

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first pantheon of each race was built of
intellectual speculations. In a moral sense, each form in it might be
described as more or less demonic; and, indeed, it may almost be
affirmed that religion, considered as a service rendered to superhuman
beings, began with the propitiation of demons, albeit they might be
called gods. Man found that in the earth good things came with
difficulty, while thorns and weeds sprang up everywhere. The evil
powers seemed to be the strongest. The best deity had a touch of the
demon in him. The sun is the most beneficent, yet he bears the
sunstroke along with the sunbeam, and withers the blooms he calls
forth. The splendour, the might, the majesty, the menace, the grandeur
and wrath of the heavens and the elements were blended in these
personifications, and reflected in the trembling adoration paid to
them. The flattering names given to these powers by their worshippers
must be interpreted by the costly sacrifices with which men sought to
propitiate them. No sacrifice would have been offered originally to a
purely benevolent power. The Furies were called the Eumenides,
&lsquo;the well-meaning,&rsquo; and there arises a temptation to regard
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>the name as preserving the primitive meaning of the
Sanskrit original of <span class="corr" id="xd26e984" title=
"Source: Erinys">Erinyes</span>, namely, <i>Saranyu</i>, which
signifies the morning light stealing over the sky. But the descriptions
of the Erinyes by the Greek poets&mdash;especially of &AElig;schylus,
who pictures them as black, serpent-locked, with eyes dropping blood,
and calls them hounds&mdash;show that <i>Saranyu</i> as morning light,
and thus the revealer of deeds of darkness, had gradually been degraded
into a personification of the Curse. And yet, while recognising the
name Eumenides as euphemistic, we may admire none the less the growth
of that rationalism which ultimately found in the epithet a suggestion
of the soul of good in things evil, and almost restored the beneficent
sense of Saranyu. &lsquo;I have settled in this place,&rsquo; says
Athene in the &lsquo;Eumenides&rsquo; of &AElig;schylus, &lsquo;these
mighty deities, hard to be appeased; they have obtained by lot to
administer all things concerning men. But he who has not found them
gentle knows not whence come the ills of life.&rsquo; But before the
dread Erinyes of Homer&rsquo;s age had become the &lsquo;venerable
goddesses&rsquo; (<span class="trans" title="semnai theai"><span class=
"Greek" lang="grc">&sigma;&epsilon;&mu;&nu;&alpha;&#8054;
&theta;&epsilon;&alpha;&#8054;</span></span>) of popular phrase in
Athens, or the Eumenides of the later poet&rsquo;s high insight,
piercing their Gorgon form as portrayed by himself, they had passed
through all the phases of human terror. Cowering generations had tried
to soothe the remorseless avengers by complimentary phrases. The
worship of the serpent, originating in the same fear, similarly raised
that animal into the region where poets could invest it with many
profound and beautiful significances. But these more distinctly
terrible deities are found in the shadowy border-land of mythology,
from which we may look back into ages when the fear in which worship is
born had not yet been separated into its elements of awe and
admiration, nor the heaven of supreme forces divided into ranks of
benevolent and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>malevolent beings; and, on the other hand, we may
look forward to the ages in which the moral consciousness of man begins
to form the distinctions between good and evil, right and wrong, which
changes cosmogony into religion, and impresses every deity of the
mind&rsquo;s creation to do his or her part in reflecting the physical
and moral struggles of mankind.</p>

</div>
<p>The intermediate processes by which the good and evil were detached,
and advanced to separate personification, cannot always be traced, but
the indications of their work are in most cases sufficiently clear. The
relationship, for instance, between Baal and Baal-zebub cannot be
doubted. The one represents the Sun in his glory as quickener of Nature
and painter of its beauty, the other the insect-breeding power of the
Sun. Baal-zebub is the Fly-god. Only at a comparatively recent period
did the deity of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>the Philistines, whose oracle was consulted by
Ahaziah (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2kings%201&amp;version=NRSV">2
Kings i</a>.), suffer under the reputation of being &lsquo;the Prince
of Devils,&rsquo; his name being changed by a mere pun to Beelzebul
(dung-god). It is not impossible that the modern Egyptian
mother&rsquo;s hesitation to disturb flies settling on her sleeping
child, and the sanctity attributed to various insects, originated in
the awe felt for him. The title Fly-god is parallelled by the reverent
epithet <span class="trans" title="apomuios"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7936;&pi;&#8057;&mu;&upsilon;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
applied to Zeus as worshipped at Elis,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1027src" href="#xd26e1027" name="xd26e1027src">1</a> the
<i>Myiagrus deus</i> of the Romans,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1034src"
href="#xd26e1034" name="xd26e1034src">2</a> and the <i>Myiodes</i>
mentioned by Pliny.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1040src" href=
"#xd26e1040" name="xd26e1040src">3</a> Our picture is probably from a
protecting charm, and evidently by the god&rsquo;s believers. There is
a story of a peasant woman in a French church who was found kneeling
before a marble group, and was warned by a priest that she was
worshipping the wrong figure&mdash;namely, Beelzebub. &lsquo;Never
mind,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;it is well enough to have friends on
both sides.&rsquo; The story, though now only <i>ben trovato</i>, would
represent the actual state of mind in many a Babylonian invoking the
protection of the Fly-god against formidable swarms of his venomous
subjects.</p>
<p>Not less clear is the illustration supplied by Scandinavian
mythology. In S&aelig;mund&rsquo;s Edda the evil-minded Loki
says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Odin! dost thou remember</p>
<p class="line">When we in early days</p>
<p class="line">Blended our blood together?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The two became detached very slowly; for their
separation implied the crumbling away of a great religion, and its
distribution into new forms; and a religion requires, relatively, as
long to decay as it does to grow, as we who live under a crumbling
religion have good reason to know. Protap Chunder Mozoomdar, of the
Brahmo-Somaj, in an address in London, said, &lsquo;The Indian Pantheon
has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>many millions of deities, and no space is left for
the Devil.&rsquo; He might have added that these deities have
distributed between them all the work that the Devil could perform if
he were admitted. His remark recalled to me the Eddaic story of
Loki&rsquo;s entrance into the assembly of gods in the halls of Oegir.
Loki&mdash;destined in a later age to be identified with Satan&mdash;is
angrily received by the deities, but he goes round and mentions
incidents in the life of each one which show them to be little if any
better than himself. The gods and goddesses, unable to reply, confirm
the cynic&rsquo;s criticisms in theologic fashion by tying him up with
a serpent for cord.</p>
<p>The late Theodore Parker is said to have replied to a Calvinist who
sought to convert him&mdash;&lsquo;The difference between us is simple:
your god is my devil.&rsquo; There can be little question that the
Hebrews, from whom the Calvinist inherited his deity, had no devil in
their mythology, because the jealous and vindictive Jehovah was quite
equal to any work of that kind,&mdash;as the hardening of
Pharaoh&rsquo;s heart, bringing plagues upon the land, or deceiving a
prophet and then destroying him for his false prophecies.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1061src" href="#xd26e1061" name="xd26e1061src">4</a>
The same accommodating relation of the primitive deities to all natural
phenomena will account for the absence of distinct representatives of
evil of the most primitive religions.</p>
<p>The earliest exceptions to this primeval harmony of the gods,
implying moral chaos in man, were trifling enough: the occasional
monster seems worthy of mention only to display the valour of the god
who slew him. But such were demon-germs, born out of the structural
action of the human mind so soon as it began to form some philosophy
concerning a universe upon which it had at first looked with simple
wonder, and destined to an evolution of vast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>import
when the work of moralising upon them should follow.</p>
<p>Let us take our stand beside our barbarian, but no longer savage,
ancestor in the far past. We have watched the rosy morning as it waxed
to a blazing noon: then swiftly the sun is blotted out, the tempest
rages, it is a sudden night lit only by the forked lightning that
strikes tree, house, man, with angry thunder-peal. From an instructed
age man can look upon the storm blackening the sky not as an enemy of
the sun, but one of its own superlative effects; but some thousands of
years ago, when we were all living in Eastern barbarism, we could not
conceive that a luminary whose very business it was to give light,
could be a party to his own obscuration. We then looked with pity upon
the ignorance of our ancestors, who had sung hymns to the
storm-dragons, hoping to flatter them into quietness; and we came by
irresistible logic to that Dualism which long divided the visible, and
still divides the moral, universe into two hostile camps.</p>
<p>This is the mother-principle out of which demons (in the ordinary
sense of the term) proceeded. At first few, as distinguished from the
host of deities by exceptional harmfulness, they were multiplied with
man&rsquo;s growth in the classification of his world. Their principle
of existence is capable of indefinite expansion, until it shall include
all the realms of darkness, fear, and pain. In the names of demons, and
in the fables concerning them, the struggles of man in his ages of
weakness with peril, want, and death, are recorded more fully than in
any inscriptions on stone. Dualism is a creed which all superficial
appearances attest. Side by side the desert and the fruitful land, the
sunshine and the frost, sorrow and joy, life and death, sit weaving
around every life its vesture of bright and sombre threads, and Science
alone can detect how each of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13"
href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>casts the shuttle to the other.
Enemies to each other they will appear in every realm which knowledge
has not mastered. There is a refrain, gathered from many ages, in
William Blake&rsquo;s apostrophe to the tiger:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Tiger! tiger! burning bright</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="first">That which one of the devoutest men of genius whom
England has produced thus asked was silently answered in India by the
serpent-worshipper kneeling with his tongue held in his hand; in Egypt,

<p>It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the Demon and the
Devil, though, for some purposes, they must be mentioned together. The
world was haunted with demons for many ages before there was any
embodiment of their spirit in any central form, much less any
conception of a Principle of Evil in the universe. The early demons had
no moral character, not any more than the man-eating tiger. There is no
outburst of moral indignation mingling with the shout of victory when
Indra slays Vritra, and Apollo&rsquo;s face is serene when his dart
pierces the Python. It required a much higher development of the moral
sentiment to give rise to the conception of a devil. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>Only
that intensest light could cast so black a shadow athwart the world as
the belief in a purely malignant spirit. To such a
conception&mdash;love of evil for its own sake&mdash;the word Devil is
limited in this work; Demon is applied to beings whose harmfulness is
not gratuitous, but incidental to their own satisfactions.</p>
<p>Deity and Demon are <span class="corr" id="xd26e1116" title=
"Source: forms of the same word">from words once
interchangeable</span>, and the latter has simply suffered degradation
by the conventional use of it to designate the less beneficent powers
and qualities, which originally inhered in every deity, after they were
detached from these and separately personified. Every bright god had
his shadow, so to say; and under the influence of Dualism this shadow
attained a distinct existence and personality in the popular
imagination. The principle having once been established, that what
seemed beneficent and what seemed the reverse must be ascribed to
different powers, it is obvious that the evolution of demons must be
continuous, and their distribution co-extensive with the ills that
flesh is heir to. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"

<div class="argument">
<p class="first">The degradation of deities&mdash;Indicated in
names&mdash;Legends of their fall&mdash;Incidental signs of the divine
origin of demons and devils.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The atmospheric conditions having been prepared in the
human mind for the production of demons, the particular shapes or names
they would assume would be determined by a variety of circumstances,
ethnical, climatic, political, or even accidental. They would, indeed,
be rarely accidental; but Professor Max M&uuml;ller, in his notes to
the Rig-Veda, has called attention to a remarkable instance in which
the formation of an imposing mythological figure of this kind had its
name determined by what, in all probability, was an accident. There
appears in the earliest Vedic hymns the name of Aditi, as the holy
Mother of many gods, and thrice there is mentioned the female name
Diti. But there is reason to believe that Diti is a mere reflex of
Aditi, the <i>a</i> being dropped originally by a reciter&rsquo;s
license. The later reciters, however, regarding every letter in so
sacred a book, or even the omission of a letter, as of eternal
significance, Diti&mdash;this decapitated Aditi&mdash;was evolved into
a separate and powerful being, and, every niche of beneficence being
occupied by its god or goddess, the new form was at once relegated to
the newly-defined realm of evil, where she remained as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>mother
of the enemies of the gods, the Daityas. Unhappily this accident
followed the ancient tendency by which the Furies and Vices have, with
scandalous constancy, been described in the feminine gender.</p>
<p>The close resemblance between these two names of Hindu mythology,
severally representing the best and the worst, may be thus accidental,
and only serve to show how the demon-forming tendency, after it began,
was able to press even the most trivial incidents into its service. But
generally the names of demons, and for whole races of demons, report
far more than this; and in no inquiry more than that before us is it
necessary to remember that names are things. The philological facts
supply a remarkable confirmation of the statements already made as to
the original identity of demon and deity. The word &lsquo;demon&rsquo;
itself, as we have said, originally bore a good instead of an evil
meaning. The Sanskrit <i>deva</i>, &lsquo;the shining one,&rsquo; Zend
<i>da&ecirc;va</i>, correspond with the Greek <span class="trans"
title="theos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>, Latin <i lang=
"la">deus</i>, Anglo-Saxon <i>Tiw</i>; and remain in
&lsquo;deity,&rsquo; &lsquo;deuce&rsquo; (probably; it exists in
Armorican, <i>teuz</i>, a phantom), &lsquo;devel&rsquo; (the gipsy name
for God), and <span class="corr" id="xd26e1162" title=
"Source: in &lsquo;demon.&rsquo;">Persian <i>d&#299;v,</i>
demon.</span> The Demon of Socrates represents the personification of a
being still good, but no doubt on the path of decline from pure
divinity. Plato declares that good men when they die become
&lsquo;demons,&rsquo; and he says &lsquo;demons are reporters and
carriers between gods and men.&rsquo; Our familiar word <i>bogey</i>, a
sort of nickname for an evil spirit, comes from the Slavonic word for
God&mdash;<i>bog</i>. Appearing here in the West as bogey (Welsh
<i>bwg</i>, a goblin), this word <i>bog</i> began, probably, as the
&lsquo;Baga&rsquo; of cuneiform inscriptions, a name of the Supreme
Being, or possibly the Hindu &lsquo;Bhaga,&rsquo; Lord of Life. In the
&lsquo;Bishop&rsquo;s Bible&rsquo; the passage occurs, &lsquo;Thou
shalt not be afraid of any <i>bugs</i> by night:&rsquo; the word has
been altered to &lsquo;terror.&rsquo; When we come to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>the
particular names of demons, we find many of them bearing traces of the
splendours from which they have declined. &lsquo;Siva,&rsquo; the Hindu
god of destruction, has a meaning (&lsquo;auspicious&rsquo;) derived
from <i>Sv&#299;,</i> &lsquo;thrive&rsquo;&mdash;thus related ideally
to Pluto, &lsquo;wealth&rsquo;&mdash;and, indeed, in later ages,
appears to have gained the greatest elevation. In a story of the
Persian poem Masnavi, Ahriman is mentioned with Bahman as a fire-fiend,
of which class are the Magian demons and the Jinns generally; which,
the sanctity of fire being considered, is an evidence of their high
origin. Avicenna says that the genii are ethereal animals.
Lucifer&mdash;light-bearing&mdash;is the fallen angel of the morning
star. Loki&mdash;the nearest to an evil power of the Scandinavian
personifications&mdash;is the German <i lang="de">leucht</i>, or light.
Azazel&mdash;a word inaccurately rendered &lsquo;scape-goat&rsquo; in
the Bible&mdash;appears to have been originally a deity, as the
Israelites were originally required to offer up one goat to Jehovah and
another to Azazel, a name which appears to signify the &lsquo;strength
of God.&rsquo; Gesenius and Ewald regard Azazel as a demon belonging to
the pre-Mosaic religion, but it can hardly be doubted that the four
arch-demons mentioned by the Rabbins&mdash;Sama&euml;l, Azazel,
Asa&euml;l, and Maccathiel&mdash;are personifications of the elements
as energies of the deity. Sama&euml;l would appear to mean the
&lsquo;left hand of God;&rsquo; Azazel, his strength; Asa&euml;l, his
reproductive force; and Maccathiel, his retributive power<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1192" title="Not in source">, but the origin of these
names is doubtful.</span>.</p>
<p>Although Azazel is now one of the Mussulman names for a devil, it
would appear to be nearly related to Al Uzza of the Koran, one of the
goddesses of whom the significant tradition exists, that once when
Mohammed had read, from the Sura called &lsquo;The Star,&rsquo; the
question, &lsquo;What think ye of Allat, Al Uzza, and Manah, that other
third goddess?&rsquo; he himself added, &lsquo;These are the most
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>high and beauteous damsels, whose intercession is
to be hoped for,&rsquo; the response being afterwards attributed to a
suggestion of Satan.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1199src" href=
"#xd26e1199" name="xd26e1199src">1</a> Belial is merely a word for
godlessness; it has become personified through the misunderstanding of
the phrase in the Old Testament by the translators of the Septuagint,
and thus passed into christian use, as in 2 Cor. vi. 15, &lsquo;What
concord hath Christ with Belial?&rsquo; The word is not used as a
proper name in the Old Testament, and the late creation of a demon out
of it may be set down to accident.</p>
<p>Even where the names of demons and devils bear no such traces of
their degradation from the state of deities, there are apt to be
characteristics attributed to them, or myths connected with them, which
point in the direction indicated. Such is the case with Satan, of whom
much must be said hereafter, whose Hebrew name signifies the adversary,
but who, in the Book of Job, appears among the sons of God. The name
given to the devil in the Koran&mdash;Eblis&mdash;is almost certainly
<i>diabolos</i> Arabicised; and while this Greek word is found in
Pindar<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1207src" href="#xd26e1207" name=
"xd26e1207src">2</a> (5th century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>),
meaning a slanderer, the fables in the Koran concerning Eblis describe
him as a fallen angel of the highest rank.</p>
<p>One of the most striking indications of the fall of demons from
heaven is the wide-spread belief that they are lame. Mr. Tylor has
pointed out the curious persistence of this idea in various ethnical
lines of development.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1215src" href=
"#xd26e1215" name="xd26e1215src">3</a> Hephaistos was lamed by his fall

"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>remarked
by Mr. Cox, of the name &lsquo;Vala&rsquo; (<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1223" title="Source: seducer">coverer</span>), one of the
designations of the dragon destroyed by Indra. &lsquo;In Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s romance,&rsquo; says Mr. Cox, &lsquo;Wayland is a mere
impostor, who avails himself of a popular superstition to keep up an
air of mystery about himself and his work, but the character to which
he makes pretence belongs to the genuine Teutonic
legend.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1226src" href="#xd26e1226"
name="xd26e1226src">5</a> The Persian demon Aeshma&mdash;the Asmodeus
of the Book of Tobit&mdash;appears with the same characteristic of
lameness in the &lsquo;Diable Boiteux&rsquo; of Le Sage. The christian
devil&rsquo;s clubbed or cloven foot is notorious.</p>
<p>Even the horns popularly attributed to the devil may possibly have
originated with the aureole which indicates the glory of his
&lsquo;first estate.&rsquo; Satan is depicted in various relics of
early art wearing the aureole, as in a miniature of the tenth century
(from Bible No. 6, Bib. Roy.), given by M. Didron.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1231src" href="#xd26e1231" name="xd26e1231src">6</a> The same

<p>It is through this mythologic history that the most powerful demons
have been associated in the popular imagination with stars,
planets,&mdash;Ketu in India, Saturn and Mercury the
&lsquo;Infortunes,&rsquo;&mdash;comets, and other celestial phenomena.
The examples of this are so numerous that it is impossible to deal with
them here, where I can only hope to offer a few illustrations of the
principles affirmed; and in this case it is of less importance for the
English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

the subject has been specially dealt with.<a class="noteref" id=

Incidentally, too, the astrological demons and devils must recur from
time to time in the process of our inquiry. But it will probably be
within the knowledge of some of my readers that the dread of comets and
of meteoric showers yet lingers in many parts of Christendom, and that
fear of unlucky stars has not passed away with astrologers. There is a
Scottish legend told by Hugh Miller of an avenging meteoric demon. A
shipmaster who had moored his vessel near Morial&rsquo;s Den, amused
himself by watching the lights of the scattered farmhouses. After all
the rest had gone out one light lingered for some time. When that light
too had disappeared, the shipmaster beheld a large meteor, which, with
a hissing noise, moved towards the cottage. A dog howled, an owl
whooped; but when the fire-ball had almost reached the roof, a cock
crew from within the cottage, and the meteor rose again. Thrice this
was repeated, the meteor at the third cock-crow ascending among the
stars. On the following day the shipmaster went on shore, purchased the
cock, and took it away with him. Returned from his voyage, he looked
for the cottage, and found nothing but a few blackened stones. Nearly
sixty years ago a human skeleton was found near the spot, doubled up as
if the body had been huddled into a hole: this revived the legend, and
probably added some of those traits which make it a true bit of mosaic
in the mythology of Astr&aelig;a.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1250src"
href="#xd26e1250" name="xd26e1250src">9</a></p>
<p>The fabled &lsquo;fall of Lucifer&rsquo; really signifies a process
similar to that which has been noticed in the case of Saranyu. The
morning star, like the morning light, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>revealer of the deeds of
darkness, becomes an avenger, and by evolution an instigator of the
evil it originally disclosed and punished. It may be remarked also that
though we have inherited the phrase &lsquo;Demons of Darkness,&rsquo;
it was an ancient rabbinical belief that the demons went abroad in
darkness not only because it facilitated their attacks on man, but
because being of luminous forms, they could recognise each other better
with a background of darkness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"

<p class="first">The ex-god&mdash;Deities demonised by
conquest&mdash;Theological animosity&mdash;Illustration from the
Avesta&mdash;Devil-worship an arrested Deism&mdash;Sheik Adi&mdash;Why
demons were painted ugly&mdash;Survivals of their beauty.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The phenomena of the transformation of deities into
demons meet the student of Demonology at every step. We shall have to
consider many examples of a kind similar to those which have been
mentioned in the preceding chapter; but it is necessary to present at
this stage of our inquiry a sufficient number of examples to establish
the fact that in every country forces have been at work to degrade the
primitive gods into types of evil, as preliminary to a consideration of
the nature of those forces.</p>
<p>We find the history of the phenomena suggested in the German word
for idol, <span lang="de">Abgott</span>&mdash;ex-god. Then we have
&lsquo;pagan,&rsquo; villager, and &lsquo;heathen,&rsquo; of the heath,
denoting those who stood by their old gods after others had transferred
their faith to the new. These words bring us to consider the influence
upon religious conceptions of the struggles which have occurred between
races and nations, and consequently between their religions. It must be
borne in mind that by the time any tribes had gathered to the
consistency of a nation, one of the strongest forces of its coherence
would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>be its priesthood. So soon as it became a general
belief that there were in the universe good and evil Powers, there must
arise a popular demand for the means of obtaining their favour; and
this demand has never failed to obtain a supply of priesthoods claiming
to bind or influence the pr&aelig;ternatural beings. These priesthoods
represent the strongest motives and fears of a people, and they were
gradually intrenched in great institutions involving powerful
interests. Every invasion or collision or mingling of races thus
brought their respective religions into contact and rivalry; and as no
priesthood has been known to consent peaceably to its own downfall and
the degradation of its own deities, we need not wonder that there have
been perpetual wars for religious ascendency. It is not unusual to hear
sects among ourselves accusing each other of idolatry. In earlier times
the rule was for each religion to denounce its opponent&rsquo;s gods as
devils. Gregory the Great wrote to his missionary in Britain, the Abbot
Mellitus, second Bishop of Canterbury, that &lsquo;whereas the people
were accustomed to sacrifice many oxen in honour of demons, let them
celebrate a religious and solemn festival, and not slay the animals to
the devil (diabolo), but to be eaten by themselves to the glory of
God.&rsquo; Thus the devotion of meats to those deities of our
ancestors which the Pope pronounces demons, which took place chiefly at
Yule-tide, has survived in our more comfortable Christmas banquets.
This was the fate of all the deities which Christianity undertook to
suppress. But it had been the habit of religions for many ages before.
They never denied the actual existence of the deities they were engaged
in suppressing. That would have been too great an outrage upon popular
beliefs, and might have caused a reaction; and, besides, each new
religion had an interest of its own in preserving the basis of belief
in these invisible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"
name="pb24">24</a>]</span>beings. Disbelief in the very existence of
the old gods might be followed by a sceptical spirit that might
endanger the new. So the propagandists maintained the existence of
native gods, but called them devils. Sometimes wars or intercourse
between tribes led to their fusion; the battle between opposing
religions was drawn, in which case there would be a compromise by which
several deities of different origin might continue together in the same
race and receive equal homage. The differing degrees of importance
ascribed to the separate persons of the Hindu triad in various
localities of India, suggest it as quite probable that Brahma, Vishnu,
and Siva signalled in their union the political unity of certain
districts in that country.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1281src" href=
"#xd26e1281" name="xd26e1281src">1</a> The blending of the names of
Confucius and Buddha, in many Chinese and Japanese temples, may show us
an analogous process now going on, and, indeed, the various ethnical
ideas combined in the christian Trinity render the fact stated one of
easy interpretation. But the religious difficulty was sometimes not
susceptible of compromise. The most powerful priesthood carried the
day, and they used every ingenuity to degrade the gods of their
opponents. Agathodemons were turned into kakodemons. The serpent,
worshipped in many lands, might be adopted as the support of sleeping
Vishnu in India, might be associated with the rainbow (&lsquo;the
heavenly serpent&rsquo;) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>in Persia, but elsewhere was cursed
as the very genius of evil.</p>
<p>The operation of this force in the degradation of deities, is
particularly revealed in the Sacred Books of Persia. In that country
the great religions of the East would appear to have contended against
each other with especial fury, and their struggles were probably
instrumental in causing one or more of the early migrations into
Western Europe. The great celestial war between Ormuzd and
Ahriman&mdash;Light and Darkness&mdash;corresponded with a violent
theological conflict, one result of which is that the word <i>deva</i>,
meaning &lsquo;deity&rsquo; to Brahmans, means &lsquo;devil&rsquo; to
Parsees. The following extract from the Zend-Avesta will serve as an
example of the spirit in which the war was waged:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All your devas are only manifold children of the Evil
Mind&mdash;and the great one who worships the Saoma of lies and
deceits; besides the treacherous acts for which you are notorious
throughout the seven regions of the earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have invented all the evil which men speak and do, which
is indeed pleasant to the Devas, but is devoid of all goodness, and
therefore perishes before the insight of the truth of the wise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thus you defraud men of their good minds and of their
immortality by your evil minds&mdash;as well through those of the Devas
as that of the Evil Spirit&mdash;through evil deeds and evil words,
whereby the power of liars grows.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1297src" href="#xd26e1297" name="xd26e1297src">2</a></p>
<p>That is to say&mdash;Ours is the true god: your god is a devil.</p>
<p>The Zoroastrian conversion of <i>deva</i> (deus) into <i>devil</i>
does not alone represent the work of this <i lang="la">odium
theologicum</i>. In the early hymns of India the appellation
<i>asuras</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>is given to the gods. Asura means a spirit. But in
the process of time <i>asura</i>, like d&aelig;mon, came to have a
sinister meaning: the gods were called <i>suras</i>, the demons
<i>asuras</i>, and these were said to contend together. But in Persia
the <i>asuras</i>&mdash;demonised in India&mdash;retained their
divinity, and gave the name <i>ahura</i> to the supreme deity, Ormuzd
(Ahura-mazda). On the other hand, as Mr. Muir supposes, <i>Varenya</i>,
applied to evil spirits of darkness in the Zendavesta, is cognate with
Varuna (Heaven); and the Vedic Indra, king of the gods&mdash;the
Sun&mdash;is named in the Zoroastrian religion as one of the chief
councillors of that Prince of Darkness.</p>
<p>But in every country conquered by a new religion, there will always
be found some, as we have seen, who will hold on to the old deity under
all his changed fortunes. These will be called &lsquo;bigots,&rsquo;
but still they will adhere to the ancient belief and practise the old
rites. Sometimes even after they have had to yield to the popular
terminology, and call the old god a devil, they will find some reason
for continuing the transmitted forms. It is probable that to this cause
was originally due the religions which have been developed into what is
now termed Devil-worship. The distinct and avowed worship of the evil
Power in preference to the good is a rather startling phenomenon when
presented baldly; as, for example, in a prayer of the Madagascans to
Nyang, author of evil, quoted by Dr. R&eacute;ville:&mdash;&lsquo;O
Zamhor! to thee we offer no prayers. The good god needs no asking. But
we must pray to Nyang. Nyang must be appeased. O Nyang, bad and strong
spirit, let not the thunder roar over our heads! Tell the sea to keep
within its bounds! Spare, O Nyang, the ripening fruit, and dry not up
the blossoming rice! Let not our women bring forth children on the
accursed days. Thou reignest, and this thou knowest, over the wicked;

then, any longer the good folk!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>This is natural, and suggestive of the criminal under sentence of
death, who, when asked if he was not afraid to meet his God, replied,
&lsquo;Not in the least; it&rsquo;s that other party I&rsquo;m afraid
of.&rsquo; Yet it is hardly doubtful that the worship of Nyang began in
an era when he was by no means considered morally baser than Zamhor.
How the theory of Dualism, when attained, might produce the phenomenon
called Devil-worship, is illustrated in the case of the Yezedis, now so
notorious for that species of religion. Their theory is usually
supposed to be entirely represented by the expression uttered by one of
them, &lsquo;Will not Satan, then, reward the poor Izedis, who alone
have never spoken ill of him, and have suffered so much for
him?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1347src" href="#xd26e1347" name=
"xd26e1347src">4</a> But these words are significant, no doubt, of the
underlying fact: they &lsquo;have never spoken ill of&rsquo; the Satan
they worship. The Mussulman calls the Yezedi a Satan-worshipper only as
the early Zoroastrian held the worshipper of a <i>deva</i> to be the
same. The chief object of worship among the Yezedis is the figure of
the bird <i>Taous</i>, a half-mythical peacock. Professor King of
Cambridge traces the <i>Taous</i> of this Assyrian sect to the
&ldquo;sacred bird called a ph&oelig;nix,&rdquo; whose picture, as seen
by Herodotus (ii. 73) in Egypt, is described by him as &lsquo;very like
an eagle in outline and in size, but with plumage partly gold-coloured,
partly crimson,&rsquo; and which was said to return to Heliopolis every
five hundred years, there to burn itself on the altar of the Sun, that
another might rise from its ashes.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1359src"
href="#xd26e1359" name="xd26e1359src">5</a> Now the name Yezedis is
simply Izeds, genii; and we are thus pointed to Arabia, where we find
the belief in genii <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28"
name="pb28">28</a>]</span>is strongest, and also associated with the
mythical bird <i>Rokh</i> of its folklore. There we find Mohammed
rebuking the popular belief in a certain bird called Ham&acirc;h, which
was said to take form from the blood near the brain of a dead person
and fly away, to return, however, at the end of every hundred years to
visit that person&rsquo;s sepulchre. But this is by no means
Devil-worship, nor can we find any trace of that in the most sacred
scripture of the Yezedis, the &lsquo;Eulogy of Sheikh Adi.&rsquo; This
Sheikh inherited from his father, Moosafir, the sanctity of an
incarnation of the divine essence, of which he (Adi) speaks as
&lsquo;the All-merciful.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">The reverence shown in these sacred sentences for
Hebrew names and traditions&mdash;as of Adam in Paradise, Marah, and
the smitten rock&mdash;and for Ahmet (Mohammed), appears <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>to have
had its only requital in the odious designation of the worshippers of
<i>Taous</i> as Devil-worshippers, a label which the Yezedis perhaps
accepted as the Wesleyans and Friends accepted such names as
&lsquo;Methodist&rsquo; and &lsquo;Quaker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mohammed has expiated the many deities he degraded to devils by
being himself turned to an idol (mawmet), a term of contempt all the
more popular for its resemblance to &lsquo;mummery.&rsquo; Despite his
denunciations of idolatry, it is certain that this earlier religion
represented by the Yezedis has never been entirely suppressed even
among his own followers. In Dr. Leitner&rsquo;s interesting collection
there is a lamp, which he obtained from a mosque, made in the shape of
a peacock, and this is but one of many similar relics of primitive or
alien symbolism found among the Mussulman tribes.</p>

<p>The evolution of demons and devils out of deities was made real to
the popular imagination in every country where the new religion found
art existing, and by alliance with it was enabled to shape the ideas of
the people. The theoretical degradation of deities of previously fair
association could only be completed where they were presented to the
eye in repulsive forms. It will readily occur to every one that a
rationally conceived demon or devil would not be repulsive. If it were
a demon that man wished to represent, mere euphemism would prevent its
being rendered odious. The main characteristic of a demon&mdash;that
which distinguishes it from a devil&mdash;is, as we have seen, that it
has a real and human-like motive for whatever evil it causes. If it
afflict or consume man, it is not from mere malignancy, but because
impelled by the pangs of hunger, lust, or other suffering, like the
famished wolf or shark. And if sacrifices of food were offered to
satisfy its need, equally we might expect that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>no
unnecessary insult would be offered in the attempt to portray it. But
if it were a devil&mdash;a being actuated by simple
malevolence&mdash;one of its essential functions, temptation, would be
destroyed by hideousness. For the work of seduction we might expect a
devil to wear the form of an angel of light, but by no means to
approach his intended victim in any horrible shape, such as would repel
every mortal. The great representations of evil, whether imagined by
the speculative or the religious sense, have never been, originally,
ugly. The gods might be described as falling swiftly like lightning out
of heaven, but in the popular imagination they retained for a long time
much of their splendour. The very ingenuity with which they were
afterwards invested with ugliness in religious art, attests that there
were certain popular sentiments about them which had to be distinctly
reversed. It was because they were thought beautiful that they must be
painted ugly; it was because they were&mdash;even among converts to the
new religion&mdash;still secretly believed to be kind and helpful, that
there was employed such elaboration of hideous designs to deform them.
The pictorial representations of demons and devils will come under a
more detailed examination hereafter: it is for the present sufficient
to point out that the traditional blackness or ugliness of demons and
devils, as now thought of, by no means militates against the fact that
they were once the popular deities. The contrast, for instance, between
the horrible physiognomy given to Satan in ordinary christian art, and
the theological representation of him as the Tempter, is obvious. Had
the design of Art been to represent the theological theory, Satan would
have been portrayed in a fascinating form. But the design was not that;
it was to arouse horror and antipathy for the native deities to which
the ignorant clung tenaciously. It was to train <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>children
to think of the still secretly-worshipped idols as frightful and
bestial beings. It is important, therefore, that we should guard
against confusing the speculative or moral attempts of mankind to
personify pain and evil with the ugly and brutal demons and devils of
artificial superstition, oftenest pictured on church walls. Sometimes
they are set to support water-spouts, often the brackets that hold
their foes, the saints. It is a very ancient device. Our figure 2 is
from the handle of a chalice in possession of Sir James Hooker, meant
probably to hold the holy water of Ganges. These are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>not
genuine demons or devils, but carefully caricatured deities. Who that
looks upon the grinning bestial forms carved about the roof of any old
church&mdash;as those on Melrose Abbey and York Cathedral<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1431src" href="#xd26e1431" name=
"xd26e1431src">7</a>&mdash;which, there is reason to believe, represent
the primitive deities driven from the interior by potency of holy
water, and chained to the uncongenial service of supporting the
roof-gutter&mdash;can see in these gargoyles (Fr. <i>gargouille</i>,
dragon), anything but carved imprecations? Was it to such ugly beings,
guardians of their streams, hills, and forests, that our ancestors
consecrated the holly and mistletoe, or with such that they associated
their flowers, fruits, and homes? They were caricatures inspired by
missionaries, made to repel and disgust, as the images of saints beside
them were carved in beauty to attract. If the pagans had been the
artists, the good looks would have been on the other side. And indeed
there was an art of which those pagans were the unconscious possessors,
through which the true characters of the imaginary beings they adored
have been transmitted to us. In the fables of their folklore we find
the Fairies that represent the spirit of the gods and goddesses to
which they are easily traceable. That goddess who in christian times
was pictured as a hag riding on a broom-stick was Frigga, the
Earth-mother, associated with the first sacred affections clustering
around the hearth; or Freya, whose very name was consecrated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>in <i>frau</i>, woman and wife. The mantle of
Bertha did not cover more tenderness when it fell to the shoulders of
Mary. The German child&rsquo;s name for the pre-christian Madonna was
Mother Rose: distaff in hand, she watched over the industrious at their
household work: she hovered near the cottage, perhaps to find there
some weeping Cinderella and give her beauty for ashes. <span class=

&lsquo;Any Orientalist will appreciate the wonderful hotchpot of Hindu
and Arabic language and religion in the following details, noted down
among rude tribes of the Malay Peninsula. We hear of Jin Bumi, the
earth-god (Arabic jin = demon, Sanskrit bh&uuml;mi = earth); incense is
burnt to Jewajewa (Sanskrit dewa = god), who intercedes with Pirman,
the supreme invisible deity above the sky (Brahma?); the Moslem Allah
T&aacute;ala, with his wife Nabi Mahamad (Prophet Mohammed), appear in
the Hinduised characters of creator and destroyer of all things; and
while the spirits worshipped in stones are called by the Hindu term of
&lsquo;dewa&rsquo; or deity, Moslem conversion has so far influenced
the mind of the stone-worshipper that he will give to his sacred

<p class="first">The obstructions of man&mdash;The twelve chief
classes&mdash;Modifications of particular forms for various
functions&mdash;Theological demons.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The statements made concerning the fair names of the
chief demons and devils which have haunted the imagination of mankind,
heighten the contrast between their celestial origin and the functions
attributed to them in their degraded forms. The theory of Dualism,
representing a necessary stage in the mental development of every race,
called for a supply of demons, and the supply came from the innumerable
dethroned, outlawed, and fallen deities and angels which had followed
the subjugation of races and their religions. But though their
celestial origin might linger around them in some slight legend or
characteristic as well as in their names, the evil phenomenon to which
each was attached as an explanation assigned the real form and work
with which he or she was associated in popular superstition. We
therefore find in the demons in which men have believed a complete
catalogue of the obstacles with which they have had to contend in the
long struggle for existence. In the devils we discover equally the
history of the moral and religious struggles through which priesthoods
and churches have had to pass. And the relative extent of this or that
particular class of demons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>or devils, and the intensity of
belief in any class as shown in the number of survivals from it, will
be found to reflect pretty faithfully the degree to which the special
evil represented by it afflicted primitive man, as attested by other
branches of pre-historic investigation.</p>
<p>As to function, the demons we shall have to consider are those
representing&mdash;1. Hunger; 2. Excessive Heat; 3. Excessive Cold; 4.
Destructive elements and physical convulsions; 5. Destructive animals;
6. Human enemies; 7. The Barrenness of the Earth, as rock and desert;
8. Obstacles, as the river or mountain; 9. Illusion, seductive,
invisible, and mysterious agents, causing delusions; 10. Darkness
(especially when unusual), Dreams, Nightmare; 11. Disease; 12.
Death.</p>
<p>These classes are selected, in obedience to necessary limitations,
as representing the twelve chief labours of man which have given shape
to the majority of his haunting demons, as distinguished from his
devils. Of course all classifications of this character must be
understood as made for convenience, and the divisions are not to be too
sharply taken. What Plotinus said of the gods, that each contained all
the rest, is equally true of both demons and devils. The demons of
Hunger are closely related to the demons of Fire: Agni devoured his
parents (two sticks consumed by the flame they produce); and from them
we pass easily to elemental demons, like the lightning, or demons of
fever. And similarly we find a relationship between other destructive
forces. Nevertheless, the distinctions drawn are not fanciful, but
exist in clear and unmistakable beliefs as to the special dispositions
and employments of demons; and as we are not engaged in dealing with
natural phenomena, but with superstitions concerning them, the only
necessity of this classification is that it shall not be arbitrary, but
shall really simplify the immense <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36"
href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>mass of facts which the student
of Demonology has to encounter.</p>
<p>But there are several points which require especial attention as
preliminary to a consideration of these various classes of demons.</p>
<p>First, it is to be borne in mind that a single demonic form will
often appear in various functions, and that these must not be confused.
The serpent may represent the lightning, or the coil of the whirlwind,
or fatal venom; the earthquake may represent a swallowing Hunger-demon,
or the rage of a chained giant. The separate functions must not be lost
sight of because sometimes traceable to a single form, nor their
practical character suffer disguise through their fair euphemistic or
mythological names.</p>
<p>Secondly, the same form appears repeatedly in a diabolic as well as
a demonic function, and here a clear distinction must be maintained in
the reader&rsquo;s mind. The distinction already taken between a demon
and a devil is not arbitrary: the word demon is related to deity; the
word devil, though sometimes connected with the Sanskrit <i>deva</i>,
has really no relation to it, but has a bad sense as
&lsquo;calumniator:&rsquo; but even if there were no such etymological
identity and difference, it would be necessary to distinguish such
widely separate offices as those representing the afflictive forces of
nature where attributed to humanly appreciable motives on the one hand,
and evils ascribed to pure malignancy or a principle of evil on the
other. The Devil may, indeed, represent a further evolution in the line
on which the Demon has appeared; Ahriman the Bad in conflict with
Ormuzd the Good may be a spiritualisation of the conflict between Light
and Darkness, Sun and Cloud, as represented in the Vedic Indra and
Vritra; but the two phases represent different classes of ideas, indeed
different worlds, and the apprehension <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>of both requires that
they shall be carefully distinguished even when associated with the
same forms and names.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is an important class of demons which the reader may
expect to find fully treated of in the part of my work more
particularly devoted to Demonology, which must be deferred, or further
traced in that portion relating to the Devil; they are forms which in
their original conception were largely beneficent, and have become of
evil repute mainly through the anathema of theology. The chequer-board
on which Osiris sat had its development in hosts of primitive shapes of
light opposing shapes of darkness. The evil of some of these is ideal;
others are morally amphibious: Teraphim, Lares, genii, were ancestors
of the guardian angels and patron saints of the present day; they were
oftenest in the shapes of dogs and cats and aged human ancestors,
supposed to keep watch and ward about the house, like the friendly
Domovoi respected in Russia; the evil disposition and harmfulness
ascribed to them are partly natural but partly also theological, and
due to the difficulty of superseding them with patron saints and
angels. The degradation of beneficent beings, already described in
relation to large demonic and diabolic forms, must be understood as
constantly acting in the smallest details of household superstition,
with what strange reaction and momentous result will appear when we
come to consider the phenomena of Witchcraft.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be remarked that the nature of our inquiry renders
the consideration of the origin of myths&mdash;whether
&lsquo;solar&rsquo; or other&mdash;of secondary importance. Such origin
it will be necessary to point out and discuss incidentally, but our
main point will always be the forms in which the myths have become
incarnate, and their modifications in various places and times, these
being the result <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>of those actual experiences with which Demonology
is chiefly concerned. A myth, as many able writers have pointed out,
is, in its origin, an explanation by the uncivilised mind of some
natural phenomenon&mdash;not an allegory, not an esoteric
conceit<span class="corr" id="xd26e1483" title="Not in source">.</span>
For this reason it possesses fluidity, and takes on manifold shapes.
The apparent sleep of the sun in winter may be represented in a vast
range of myths, from the Seven Sleepers to the Man in the Moon of our
nursery rhyme; but the variations all have relation to facts and
circumstances. Comparative Mythology is mainly concerned with the one
thread running through them, and binding them all to the original myth;
the task of Demonology is rather to discover the agencies which have
given their several shapes. If it be shown that Orthros and Cerberus
were primarily the morning and evening twilight or howling winds,
either interpretation is here secondary to their personification as
dogs. Demonology would ask, Why dogs? why not bulls? Its answer in each
case detaches from the anterior myth its mode, and shows this as the
determining force of further myths. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"

<p class="first">In every part of the earth man&rsquo;s first struggle
was for his daily food. With only a rude implement of stone or bone he
had to get fish from the sea, bird from the air, beast from the forest.
For ages, with such poor equipment, he had to wring a precarious
livelihood from nature. He saw, too, every living form around him
similarly trying to satisfy its hunger. There seemed to be a Spirit of
Hunger abroad. And, at the same time, there was such a resistance to
man&rsquo;s satisfaction of his need&mdash;the bird and fish so hard to
get, the stingy earth so ready to give him a stone when he asked for
bread&mdash;that he came to the conclusion that there must be invisible
voracious beings who wanted all good things for themselves. So the
ancient world was haunted by a vast brood of Hunger-demons. There is an
African tribe, the Karens, whose representation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>of the
Devil (Kephn) is a huge stomach floating through the air; and this
repulsive image may be regarded as the type of nearly half the demons
which have haunted the human imagination. This, too, is the terrible
Miru, with her daughters and slave, haunting the South Sea Islander.
&lsquo;The esoteric doctrine of the priests was, that souls leave the
body ere breath has quite gone, and travel to the edge of a cliff
facing the setting sun (R&#257;). A large wave now approaches the base
of the cliff, and a gigantic <i>bua</i> tree, covered with fragrant
blossoms, springs up from Avaiki (nether world) to receive on its
far-reaching branches human spirits, who are mysteriously impelled to
cluster on its limbs. When at length the mystic tree is covered with
human spirits, it goes down with its living freight to the nether
world. Akaanga, the slave of fearful Miru, mistress of the invisible
world, infallibly catches all these unhappy spirits in his net and
laves them to and fro in a lake. In these waters the captive ghosts
exhaust themselves by wriggling about like fishes, in the vain hope of
escape. The net is pulled up, and the half-drowned spirits enter into
the presence of dread Miru, who is ugliness personified. The secret of
Miru&rsquo;s power over her intended victims is the &lsquo;kava&rsquo;
root (<i lang="la">Piper mythisticum</i>). A bowl of this drink is
prepared for each visitor to the shades by her four lovely daughters.
Stupefied with the draught, the unresisting victims are borne off to a
mighty oven and cooked. Miru, her peerless daughters, her dance-loving
son, and the attendants, subsist exclusively on human spirits decoyed
to the nether world and then cooked. The drinking-cups of Miru are the
skulls of her victims. She is called in song
&lsquo;Miru-the-ruddy,&rsquo; because her cheeks ever glow with the
heat of the oven where her captives are cooked. As the surest way to
Miru&rsquo;s oven is to die a natural death, one need not marvel that
the Rev. Mr. Gill, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span>who made these statements before the
Anthropological Institute in London (February 8, 1876), had heard
&lsquo;many anecdotes of aged warriors, scarcely able to hold a spear,
insisting on being led to the field of battle in the hope of gaining
the house of the brave.&rsquo; As the South Sea paradise seems to
consist in an eternal war-dance, or, in one island, in an eternal
chewing of sugar-cane, it is not unlikely that the aged seek violent
death chiefly to avoid the oven. We have here a remarkable illustration
of the distinguishing characteristic of the demon. Fearful as Miru is,
it may be noted that there is not one gratuitous element of cruelty in
her procedure. On the contrary, she even provides her victims with an
an&aelig;sthetic draught. Her prey is simply netted, washed, and
cooked, as for man are his animal inferiors. In one of the islands
(Aitutaki), Miru is believed to resort to a device which is certainly
terrible&mdash;namely, the contrivance that each soul entering the
nether world shall drink a bowl of living centipedes; but this is
simply with the one end in view of appeasing her own pangs of hunger,
for the object and effect of the draught is to cause the souls to drown
themselves, it being apparently only after entire death that they can
be cooked and devoured by Miru and her household.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the islanders, Miru is limited in her tortures to a
transmundane sphere, and room is left for many a slip between her
dreadful cup and the human lip. The floating stomach Kephn is, however,
not other-worldly. We see, however, a softened form of him in some
other tribes. The Greenlanders, Finns, Laps, conceived the idea that
there is a large paunch-demon which people could invoke to go and suck
the cows or consume the herds of their enemies; and the Icelanders have
a superstition that some people can construct such a demon out of bones
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>skins, and send him forth to transmute the milk or
flesh of cattle into a supply of flesh and blood. A form of this kind
is represented in the Japanese Kagura (<a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>),
the favourite mask of January dancers and drum-beaters seeking money.
The Kagura is in precise contrast with the Pretas (Siam), which, though
twelve miles in height, are too thin to be seen, their mouths being so
small as to render it impossible to satisfy their fearful hunger.</p>
<p>The pot-bellies given to demons in Travancore and other districts of
India, and the blood-sacrifices by which the natives propitiate
them&mdash;concerning which a missionary naively remarks, that even
these heathen recognise, though in corrupted form, &lsquo;the great
truth that without shedding of blood there is no remission of
sins&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1523src" href="#xd26e1523" name=
"xd26e1523src">1</a>&mdash;refer to the Hunger-demon. They are the
brood of Kali, girt round with human skulls.</p>

<p>The expedition which went out to India to observe the last solar
eclipse was incidentally the means of calling attention to a remarkable
survival of the Hunger-demon in connection with astronomic phenomena.
While the English observers were arranging their apparatus, the natives
prepared a pile of brushwood, and, so soon as the eclipse began, they
set fire to this pile and began to shout and yell as they danced around
it. Not less significant were the popular observances generally. There
was a semi-holiday in honour of the eclipse. The ghauts were crowded
with pious worshippers. No Hindu, it is thought, ought to do any work
whatever during an eclipse, and there <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>was a general tendency to
prolong the holiday a little beyond the exact time when the shadow
disappears, and indeed to prolong it throughout the day. All
earthenware vessels used for cooking were broken, and all cooked food
in the houses at the time of the eclipse was thrown out. It is regarded
as a time of peculiar blessings if taken in the right way, and of dread
consequences to persons inclined to heterodoxy or neglect of the proper
observances. Between nine and ten in the evening two shocks of an
earthquake occurred, the latter a rather unpleasant one, shaking the
tables and doors in an uncomfortable fashion for several seconds. To
the natives it was no surprise&mdash;they believe firmly in the
connection of eclipses and earthquakes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1537src" href="#xd26e1537" name="xd26e1537src">2</a></p>
<p>Especially notable is the breaking of their culinary utensils by the
Hindus during an eclipse. In Copenhagen there is a collection of the
votive weapons of ancient Norsemen, every one broken as it was offered
up to the god of their victory in token of good faith, lest they should
be suspected of any intention to use again what they had given away.
For the same reason the cup was offered&mdash;broken&mdash;with the
libation. The Northman felt himself in the presence of the J&ouml;tunn
(giants), whose name Grimm identifies as the Eaters. For the Hindu of
to-day the ceremonies appropriate at an eclipse, however important,
have probably as little rational meaning as the occasional Belfire that
lights up certain dark corners of Europe has for those who build it.
But the traditional observances have come up from the childhood of the
world, when the eclipse represented a demon devouring the sun, who was
to have his attention called by outcries and prayers to the fact that
if it was fire he needed there was plenty on earth; and if food, he
might have all in their houses, provided he would consent to satisfy
his appetite <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>with articles of food less important than the
luminaries of heaven.</p>
<p>Such is the shape now taken in India of the ancient myth of the
eclipse. When at the churning of the ocean to find the nectar of
immortality, a demon with dragon-tail was tasting that nectar, the sun
and moon told on him, but not until his head had become immortal; and
it is this head of R&aacute;hu which seeks now to devour the
informers&mdash;the Sun and Moon.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1546src"
href="#xd26e1546" name="xd26e1546src">3</a> Mythologically, too, this
R&aacute;hu has been divided; for we shall hereafter trace the
dragon-tail of him to the garden of Eden and in the christian devil,
whereas in India he has been improved from a vindictive to a merely
voracious demon.</p>
<p>The fires kindled by the Hindus to frighten R&aacute;hu on his
latest appearance might have defeated the purpose of the expedition by
the smoke it was sending up, had not two officers leaped upon the fire
and scattered its fuel; but just about the time when these courageous
gentlemen were trampling out the fires of superstition whose smoke
would obscure the vision of science, an event occurred in England which
must be traced to the same ancient belief&mdash;the belief, namely,
that when anything is apparently swallowed up, as the sun and moon by
an eclipse, or a village by earthquake or flood, it is the work of a
hungry dragon, earthworm, or other monster. The Pelsall mine was
flooded, and a large number of miners drowned. When the accident became
known in the village, the women went <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>out with the families of
the unfortunate men, and sat beside the mouth of the flooded pit, at
the bottom of which the dead bodies yet remained. These women then
yelled down the pit with voices very different from ordinary
lamentation. They also refused unanimously to taste food of any kind,
saying, when pressed to do so, that so long as they could refrain from
eating, their husbands might still be spared to them. When, finally,
one poor woman, driven by the pangs of hunger, was observed to eat a
crust of bread, the cries ceased, and the women, renouncing all hope,
proceeded in silent procession to their homes in Pelsall.</p>
<p>The Hindu people casting their food out of the window during an
eclipse, the Pelsall wives refusing to eat when the mine is flooded,
are acting by force of immemorial tradition, and so are doing
unconsciously what the African woman does consciously when she
surrounds the bed of her sick husband with rice and meat, and beseeches
the demon to devour them instead of the man. To the same class of
notions belong the old custom of trying to discover the body of one
drowned by means of a loaf of bread with a candle stuck in it, which it
was said would pause above the body, and the body might be made to
appear by firing a gun over it&mdash;that is, the demon holding it
would be frightened off. A variant, too, is the Persian custom of
protecting a woman in parturition by spreading a table, with a lamp at
each corner, with seven kinds of fruits and seven different aromatic
seeds upon it.</p>
<p>In 1769, when Pennant made his &lsquo;Scottish Tour,&rsquo; he found
fully observed in the Highlands the ceremony of making the Beltane Cake
on the first of May, and dedicating its distributed fragments to birds
and beasts of prey, with invocation to the dread being of whom they
were the supposed agents to spare the herds. Demons <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>especially love milk: the Lambton Worm required
nine cows&rsquo; milk daily; and Jerome mentions a diabolical baby
which exhausted six nurses.</p>
<p>The Devil nominally inherits, among the peasantry of Christendom,
the attributes of the demons which preceded him; but it must be
understood that in every case where mere voracity is ascribed to the
Devil, a primitive demon is meant, and of this fact the superstitious
peasant is dimly conscious. In Franconia, when a baker is about to put
dough biscuits into an oven to be baked, he will first throw
half-a-dozen of them into the fire, saying, &lsquo;There, poor devil!
those are for you.&rsquo; If pressed for an explanation, he will admit
his fear that but for this offering his biscuits are in danger of
coming out burnt; but that the &lsquo;poor devil&rsquo; is not
bad-hearted, only driven by his hunger to make mischief. The being he
fears is, therefore, clearly not the Devil at all&mdash;whose
distinction is a love of wickedness for its own sake&mdash;but the
half-starved gobbling ghosts of whom, in Christian countries,
&lsquo;Devil&rsquo; has become the generic name. Of their sacrifices,
Grace before meat is a remnant. In Moslem countries, however,
&lsquo;Sheitan&rsquo; combines the demonic and the malignant
voracities. During the late lunar eclipse, the inhabitants of Pera and
Constantinople fired guns over their houses to drive
&lsquo;Sheitan&rsquo; (Satan) away from the moon, for, whoever the foe,
the Turk trusts in gunpowder. But superstitions representing Satan as a
devourer are becoming rare. In the church of N&ocirc;tre Dame at Hal,
Belgium, the lectern shows a dragon attempting to swallow the Bible,
which is supported on the back of an eagle.</p>
<p>There is another and much more formidable form in which the
Hunger-demon appears in Demonology. The fondness for blood, so
characteristic of supreme gods, was distributed as a special thirst
through a large class of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>demons. In the legend of Ishtar
descending to Hades<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1566src" href=
"#xd26e1566" name="xd26e1566src">4</a> to seek some beloved one, she
threatens if the door be not opened&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I will raise the dead to be devourers of the
living!</p>
<p class="line">Upon the living shall the dead prey!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">This menace shows that the Chald&aelig;an and
Babylonian belief in the vampyre, called Akhkharu in Assyrian, was
fully developed at a very early date. Although the Hunger-demon was
very fully developed in India, it does not appear to have been at any
time so cannibalistic, possibly because the natives were not great
flesh-eaters. In some cases, indeed, we meet with the vampyre
superstition; as in the story of Vikram and the Vampyre, and in the
Tamil drama of Harich&aacute;ndra, where the frenzied Sandram&aacute;ti
says to the king, &lsquo;I belong to the race of elves, and I have
killed thy child in order that I might feed on its delicate
flesh.&rsquo; Such expressions are rare enough to warrant suspicion of
their being importations. The Vetala&rsquo;s appetite is chiefly for
corpses. The poor hungry demons of India&mdash;such as the Bh&uacute;t,
a dismal, ravenous ghost, dreaded at the moon-wane of the month Katik
(Oct.-Nov.)&mdash;was not supposed to devour man, but only man&rsquo;s
food. The Hindu demons of this class may be explained by reference to
the sr&aacute;ddha, or oblation to ancestors, concerning which we read
directions in the Manu Code. &lsquo;The ancestors of men are satisfied
a whole month with <i>tila</i>, rice, &amp;c.; two months with fish,
&amp;c. The Manes say, Oh, may that man be born in our line who may
give us milky food, with honey and pure butter, both on the thirteenth
of the moon and when the shadow of an elephant falls to the
east!&rsquo; The bloodthirsty demons of India have pretty generally
been caught up like Kali into a higher symbolism, and their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>voracity systematised and satisfied in sacrificial
commutations. The popular belief in the southern part of that country
is indicated by Professor Monier Williams, in a letter written from
Southern India, wherein he remarks that the devils alone require
propitiation. It is generally a simple procedure, performed by
offerings of food or other articles supposed to be acceptable to
disembodied beings. For example, when a certain European, once a terror
to the district in which he lived, died in the South of India, the
natives were in the constant habit of depositing brandy and cigars on
his tomb to propitiate his spirit, supposed to roam about the
neighbourhood in a restless manner, and with evil proclivities. The
very same was done to secure the good offices of the philanthropic
spirit of a great European sportsman, who, when he was alive, delivered
his district from the ravages of tigers. Indeed all evil spirits are
thought to be opposed by good ones, who, if duly propitiated, make it
their business to guard the inhabitants of particular places from
demonic intruders. Each district, and even every village, has its
guardian genius, often called its Mother.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1581src" href="#xd26e1581" name="xd26e1581src">5</a></p>
<p>Such ideas as these are represented in Europe in some varieties of
the Kobold and the Goblin (Gk. <span class="trans" title=
"kobalos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&kappa;&#8057;&beta;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>).
Though the goblin must, according to folk-philosophy, be fed with nice
food, it is not a deadly being; on the contrary, it is said the Gobelin
tapestry derives its name because the secret of its colours was gained
from these ghosts. Though St. Taurin expelled one from Evreux, he found
it so polite that he would not send it to hell, and it still haunts the
credulous there and at Caen, without being thought very formidable.</p>
<p>The demon that &lsquo;lurks in graveyards&rsquo; is universal, and
may have suggested cremation. In the East it is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>represented mainly by such forms as the repulsive
<i>ghoul</i>, which preys on dead bodies; but it has been developed in
some strange way to the Slavonic phantom called Vampyre, whose peculiar
fearfulness is that it represents the form in which any deceased person
may reappear, not ghoul-like to batten on the dead, but to suck the
blood of the living. This is perhaps the most formidable survival of
demonic superstition now existing in the world.</p>
<p>A people who still have in their dictionary such a word as
&lsquo;miscreant&rsquo; (misbeliever) can hardly wonder that the
priests of the Eastern Church fostered the popular belief that heretics
at death changed into drinkers of the blood of the living. The Slavonic
vampyres have declined in England and America to be the
&lsquo;Ogres,&rsquo; who &lsquo;smell the blood of an
Englishman,&rsquo; but are rarely supposed to enjoy it; but it exposes
the real ugliness of the pious superstitions sometimes deemed pretty,
that, in proportion to the intensity of belief in supernaturalism, the
people live in terror of the demons that go about seeking whom they may
devour. In Russia the watcher beside a corpse is armed with holy charms
against attack from it at midnight. A vampyre may be the soul of any
outcast from the Church, or one over whose corpse, before burial, a cat
has leaped or a bird flown. It may be discovered in a graveyard by
leading a black colt through; the animal will refuse to tread on the
vampyre&rsquo;s grave, and the body is taken out and a stake driven
through it, always by a single blow. A related class of demons are the
&lsquo;heart-devourers.&rsquo; They touch their victim with an aspen or
other magical twig; the heart falls out, and is, perhaps, replaced by
some baser one. Mr. Ralston mentions a Mazovian story in which a hero
awakes with the heart of a hare, and remains a coward ever
after;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1603src" href="#xd26e1603" name=
"xd26e1603src">6</a> and in another case a quiet peasant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>received
a cock&rsquo;s heart and was always crowing. The Werewolf, in some
respects closely related to the vampyre, also pursues his ravages among
the priest-ridden peasantry of the South and East.</p>
<p>In Germany, though the more horrible forms of the superstition are
rare, the &lsquo;Nachzehrer&rsquo; is much dreaded. Even in various
Protestant regions it is thought safest that a cross should be set
beside every grave to impede any demonic propensities that may take
possession of the person interred; and where food is not still buried
with the corpse to assuage any pangs of hunger that may arise, a few
grains of corn or rice are scattered upon it in reminiscence of the old
custom. In Diesdorf it is believed that if money is not placed in the
dead person&rsquo;s mouth at burial, or his name not cut from his
shirt, he is likely to become a Nachzehrer, and that the ghost will
come forth in the form of a pig. It is considered a sure preventative
of such a result to break the neck of the dead body. On one occasion,
it is there related, several persons of one family having died, the
suspected corpse was exhumed, and found to have eaten up its own
grave-clothes.</p>
<p>Dr. Dyer, an eminent physician of Chicago, Illinois, told me (1875)
that a case occurred in that city within his personal knowledge, where
the body of a woman who had died of consumption was taken out of the
grave and the lungs burned, under a belief that she was drawing after
her into the grave some of her surviving relatives. In 1874, according
to the <i>Providence Journal</i>, in the village of Peacedale, Rhode
Island, U.S., Mr. William Rose dug up the body of his own daughter, and
burned her heart, under the belief that she was wasting away the lives
of other members of his family.</p>
<p>The characteristics of modern &lsquo;Spiritualism&rsquo; appear to
indicate that the superstitious have outgrown this ancient <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>fear of
ghostly malevolence where surrounded by civilisation. It is very rare
in the ancient world or in barbarous regions to find any invocations
for the return of the spirits of the dead. Mr. Tylor has quoted a
beautiful dirge used by the Ho tribe of India, beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">We never scolded you, never wronged you;</p>
<p class="line xd26e1623">Come to us back!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But generally funereal customs are very significant of
the fear that spirits may return, and their dirges more in the vein of
the Bodo of North-East India: &lsquo;Take and eat: heretofore you have
eaten and drunk with us, you can do so no more: you were one of us, you
can be so no longer: we come no more to you, come you not to us.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Even,&rsquo; says Mr. Tylor, &lsquo;in the lowest culture we
find flesh holding its own against spirit, and at higher stages the
householder rids himself with little scruple of an unwelcome inmate.
The Greenlanders would carry the dead out by the window, not by the
door, while an old woman, waving a firebrand behind, cried
&lsquo;Piklerrukpok!&rsquo; <i>i.e.,</i> &lsquo;There is nothing more
to be had here!&rsquo; the Hottentots removed the dead from the hut by
an opening broken out on purpose, to prevent him from finding the way
back; the Siamese, with the same intention, break an opening through
the house wall to carry the coffin through, and then hurry it at full
speed thrice round the house; the Siberian Chuwashes fling a red-hot
stone after the corpse is carried out, for an obstacle to bar the soul
from coming back; so Brandenburg peasants pour out a pail of water at
the door after the coffin to prevent the ghost from walking; and
Pomeranian mourners returning from the churchyard leave behind the
straw from the hearse, that the wandering soul may rest there, and not
come back so far as home.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1630src"

<p>It may be remarked, in this connection, that in nearly all the
pictures of demons and devils, they are represented as very lean. The
exceptions will be found generally in certain Southern and tropical
demons which represent cloud or storm&mdash;Typhon, for
instance&mdash;and present a swollen or bloated appearance. No Northern
devil is fat. Shakespeare ascribes to C&aelig;sar a suspicion of
leanness&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Yond&rsquo; Cassius hath a lean and hungry look:</p>
<p class="line">He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">When Antony defends Cassius, C&aelig;sar only replies,
&lsquo;Would he were fatter!&rsquo; This mistrust of leanness is a
reflection from all the Hunger-demons; it interprets the old sayings
that a devil, however fair in front, may be detected by hollowness of
the back, and that he is usually so thin as to cast no shadow.<a class=

<p>Illustrations of the Hunger-demon and its survivals might be greatly
multiplied, were it necessary. It need only, however, be mentioned that
it is to this early and most universal conception of
pr&aelig;ternatural danger that the idea of sacrifice as well as of
fasting must be ascribed. It is, indeed, too obvious to require
extended demonstration that the notion of offering fruits and meat to
an invisible being could only have originated in the belief that such
being was hungry, however much the spiritualisation of such offerings
may have attended their continuance among enlightened peoples. In the
evolution of purer deities, Fire&mdash;&lsquo;the devouring
element&rsquo;&mdash;was substituted for a coarser method of accepting
sacrifices, and it became a sign of baser beings&mdash;such as the
Assyrian Akhkharu, and the later Lamia&mdash;to consume dead bodies
with their teeth; and this fire was the spiritual element in the
idolatries whose objects were visible. But the original accent of
sacrifice never left it. The Levitical Law says: &lsquo;The two
kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the
caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away. And the
priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering
made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat is the Lord&rsquo;s. It
shall be a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your
dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1657src" href="#xd26e1657" name="xd26e1657src">9</a> We find
the Hunger-demon shown as well in the wrath of Jehovah against the sons
of Eli for eating the choice parts of the meats offered on his altar,
as in that offering of tender infants to Moloch which his priests
denounced, or in Saturn devouring his children, whom Aryan faith
dethroned; and they all reappear as phantoms thinly veiled above the
spotless Lamb offered up on Calvary, the sacrificed Macaria
(&lsquo;Blessed&rsquo;), the pierced heart of Mary. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>The
beautiful boy Men&oelig;ceus must be sacrificed to save Thebes; the
gods will not have aged and tough Creon, though a king, in his place.
Iphigenia, though herself saved from the refined palate of Artemis,
through the huntress&rsquo;s fondness for kid&rsquo;s blood, becomes
the priestess of human sacrifices. The human offering deemed
half-divine could alone at last satisfy the Deity, gathered in his side
this sheaf of sacrificial knives, whetted in many lands and ages, and
in his self-sacrifice the Hunger-demon himself was made the victim.
Theologians have been glad to rescue the First Person of their Trinity
from association with the bloodthirsty demons of barbarous ages by
describing the sacrifice of Jesus as God himself becoming the victim of
an eternal law. But, whatever may be said of this complex device, it is
sufficient evidence that man&rsquo;s primitive demon which personified
his hunger has ended with being consumed on his own altar. For though
fasting is a survival of the same savage notion that man may secure
benefits from invisible beings by leaving them the food, it is a
practice which survives rather through the desire of imitating ascetic
saints than because of any understood principle. The strange yet
natural consummation adds depth of meaning to the legend of Odin being
himself sacrificed in his disguise on the Holy Tree at Upsala, where
human victims were hung as offerings to him; and to his rune in the
Havamal&mdash;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fire was of old the element of fiends. No doubt this
was in part due to the fact that it also was a devouring element.
Sacrifices were burnt; the demon visibly consumed them. But the great
flame-demons represent chiefly the destructive and painful action of
intense heat. They originate in regions of burning desert, of
sunstroke, and drouth.</p>
<p>Agni, the Hindu god of fire, was adored in Vedic hymns as the twin
of Indra.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thy appearance is fair to behold, thou bright-faced Agni,
when like gold thou shinest at hand; thy brightness comes like the
lightning of heaven; thou showest splendour like the splendour of the
bright sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Adorable and excellent Agni, emit the moving and graceful
smoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The flames of Agni are luminous, powerful, fearful, and not
to be trusted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I extol the greatness of that showerer of rain, whom men
celebrate as the slayer of Vritra: the Agni, Vaiswanara, slew the
stealer of the waters.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href=
"#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>The slaying of Vritra, the monster, being the chief exploit of
Indra, Agni could only share in it as being the flame that darted with
Indra&rsquo;s weapon, the disc (of the sun).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou (Agni) art laid hold off with difficulty, like the young
of tortuously twining snakes, thou who art a consumer of many forests
as a beast is of fodder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Petrifaction awaits all these glowing metaphors of early time.
Verbal inspiration will make Agni a literally tortuous serpent and
consuming fire. His smoke, called Kali (black), is now the name of
Siva&rsquo;s terrible bride.</p>
<p>Much is said in Vedic hymns of the method of producing the sacred
flame symbolising Agni; namely, the rubbing together of two sticks.
&lsquo;He it is whom the two sticks have engendered, like a new-born
babe.&rsquo; It is a curious coincidence that a similar phrase should
describe &lsquo;the devil on two sticks,&rsquo; who has come by way of
Persia into European romance. Asmodeus was a lame demon, and his
&lsquo;two sticks&rsquo; as &lsquo;Diable Boiteux&rsquo; are crutches;
but his lameness may be referable to the attenuated extremities
suggested by spires of flame&mdash;&lsquo;tortuously twining
snakes,&rsquo;&mdash;rather than to the rabbinical myth that he broke
his leg on his way to meet Solomon. Benfey identified Asmodeus as Zend
A&ecirc;shma-da&ecirc;va, demon of lust. His goat-feet and fire-coal
eyes are described by Le Sage, and the demon says he was lamed by
falling from the air, like Vulcan, when contending with Pillardoc. It
is not difficult to imagine how flame engendered by the rubbing of
sticks might have attained personification as sensual passion,
especially among Zoroastrians, who would detach from the adorable Fire
all associations of evil. It would harmonise well with the Persian
tendency to diabolise Indian gods, that they should note the lustful
character occasionally ascribed to Agni in the Vedas. &lsquo;Him alone,
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>ever-youthful Agni, men groom like a horse in the
evening and at dawn; they bed him as a stranger in his couch; the light
of Agni, the worshipped male, is lighted.&rsquo; Agni was the Indian
&lsquo;Brulefer&rsquo; or love-charmer, and patron of marriage; the
fire-god Hephaistos was the husband of Aphrodite; the day of the Norse
thunder-and-lightning god Thor (Thursday), is in Scandinavian regions
considered the luckiest for marriages.</p>
<p>The process of obtaining fire by friction is represented by a nobler
class of myths than that referred to. In the
<i>Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata</i> the gods and demons together churn the
ocean for the nectar of immortality; and they use for their
churning-stick the mountain Manthara. This word appears in
<i>pramantha,</i> which means a fire-drill, and from it comes the great
name of Prometheus, who stole fire from heaven, and conferred on
mankind a boon which rendered them so powerful that the jealousy and
wrath of Zeus were excited. This fable is generally read in its highly
rationalised and mystical form, and on this account belongs to another
part of our general subject; but it may be remarked here that the Titan
so terribly tortured by Zeus could hardly have been regarded,
originally, as the friend of man. At the time when Zeus was a god
genuinely worshipped&mdash;when he first stood forth as the supplanter
of the malign devourer Saturn&mdash;it could have been no friend of man
who was seen chained on the rock for ever to be the vulture&rsquo;s
prey. It was fire in some destructive form which must have been then
associated with Prometheus, and not that power by which later myths
represented his animating with a divine spark the man of clay. The
Hindu myth of churning the ocean for the immortal draught, even if it
be proved that the ocean is heaven and the draught lightning, does not
help us much. The traditional association of Prometheus with the Arts
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>might almost lead one to imagine that the early
use of fire by some primitive inventor had brought upon him the wrath
of his mates, and that Zeus&rsquo; thunderbolts represented some early
&lsquo;strike&rsquo; against machinery.</p>
<p>It is not quite certain that it may not have been through some
euphemistic process that Fire-worship arose in Persia. Not only does
fire occupy a prominent place in the tortures inflicted by Ahriman in
the primitive Parsee Inferno, but it was one of the weapons by which he
attempted to destroy the heavenly child Zoroaster. The evil magicians
kindled a fire in the desert and threw the child on it; but his mother,
Dogdo, found him sleeping tranquilly on the flames, which were as a
pleasant bath, and his face shining like Zohore and Moschteri (Jupiter
and Mercury).<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1722src" href="#xd26e1722"
name="xd26e1722src">1</a> The Zoroastrians also held that the earth
would ultimately be destroyed by fire; its metals and minerals, ignited
by a comet, would form streams which all souls would have to pass
through: they would be pleasant to the righteous, but terrible to the
sinful,&mdash;who, however, would come through, purified, into
paradise, the last to arrive being Ahriman himself.</p>
<p>The combustible nature of many minerals under the surface of the
earth,&mdash;which was all the realm of Hades (invisible),&mdash;would
assist the notion of a fiery abode for the infernal gods. Our phrase
&lsquo;plutonic rock&rsquo; would then have a very prosaic sense. Pliny
says that in his time sulphur was used to keep off evil spirits, and it
is not impossible that it first came to be used as a medicine by this
route.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1730src" href="#xd26e1730" name=
"xd26e1730src">2</a></p>
<p>Fire-festivals still exist in India, where the ancient <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>raiment
of Agni has been divided up and distributed among many deities. At the
popular annual festival in honour of Dharma Rajah, called the Feast of
Fire, the devotees walk barefoot over a glowing fire extending forty
feet. It lasts eighteen days, during which time those that make a vow
to keep it must fast, abstain from women, lie on the bare ground, and
walk on a brisk fire. The eighteenth day they assemble on the sound of
instruments, their heads crowned with flowers, their bodies daubed with
saffron, and follow the figures of Dharma Rajah and Draupadi his wife
in procession. When they come to the fire, they stir it to animate its
activity, and take a little of the ashes, with which they rub their
foreheads; and when the gods have been carried three times round it
they walk over a hot fire, about forty feet. Some carry their children
in their arms, and others lances, sabres, and standards. After the
ceremony the people press to collect the ashes to rub their foreheads
with, and obtain from devotees the flowers with which they were
adorned, and which they carefully preserve.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1740src" href="#xd26e1740" name="xd26e1740src">3</a></p>
<p>The passion of Agni reappears in Draupadi purified by fire for her
five husbands, and especially her union with Dharma Rajah, son of Yama,
is celebrated in this unorthodox passion-feast. It has been so much the
fashion for travellers to look upon all &lsquo;idolatry&rsquo; with
biblical eyes, that we cannot feel certain with Sonnerat that there was
anything more significant in the carrying of children by the devotees,
than the supposition that what was good for the parent was equally
beneficial to the child. But the identification of Moloch with an Aryan
deity is not important; the Indian Feast of Fire and the rites of
Moloch are derived by a very simple mental process from the most
obvious aspects of the Sun as the quickening <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>and the
consuming power in nature. The child offered to Moloch was offered to
the god by whom he was generated, and as the most precious of all the
fruits of the earth for which his genial aid was implored and his
destructive intensity deprecated. Moloch, a word that means
&lsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd26e1747" title=
"Source: sacrifice">king</span>,&rsquo; <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1750" title="Not in source">was a name almost synonymous with
human sacrifice. It</span> was in all probability at first only a local
(Ammonite) personification growing out of an ancient shrine of Baal.
The Midianite Baal accompanied the Israelites into the wilderness, and
that worship was never thoroughly eradicated. In the Egyptian
Confession of Faith, which the initiated took even into their graves
inscribed upon a scroll, the name of God is not mentioned, but is
expressed only by the words <i>Nuk pu Nuk</i>, &lsquo;I am he who I
am.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1756src" href="#xd26e1756" name=
"xd26e1756src">4</a> The flames of the burning bush, from which these
same words came to Moses, were kindled from Baal, the Sun; and we need
not wonder that while the more enlightened chiefs of Israel preserved
the higher ideas and symbols of the countries they abandoned, the
ignorant would still cling to Apis (the Golden Calf), to Ashtaroth, and
to Moloch. Amos (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=

title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%207:43&amp;version=NRSV">Acts
vii. 43</a>), reproach the Hebrews with having carried into the
wilderness the tabernacle of their god Moloch. And though the passing
of children through the fire to Moloch was, by the Mosaic Law, made a
capital crime, the superstition and the corresponding practice retained
such strength that we find Solomon building a temple to Moloch on the
Mount of Olives (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2kings%2011:7&amp;version=NRSV">1

the fire in honour of the same god.</p>
<p>It is certain from the denunciations of the prophets<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1771src" href="#xd26e1771" name="xd26e1771src">5</a>
that the destruction of children in these flames was actual. From

href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jer%2019:6&amp;version=NRSV">
Jeremiah xix. 6</a>, as well as other sources, we know that the
burnings took place in the Valley of Tophet or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>Hinnom
(Gehenna). The idol Moloch was of brass, and its throne of brass; its
head was that of a calf, and wore a royal crown; its stomach was a
furnace, and when the children were placed in its arms they were
consumed by the fierce heat,&mdash;their cries being drowned by the
beating of drums; from which, <i>toph</i> meaning a &lsquo;drum,&rsquo;
the place was also called Tophet. In the fierce war waged against alien
superstitions by Josiah, he defiled Gehenna, filling it with ordure and
dead men&rsquo;s bones to make it odious, &lsquo;that no man might make
his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Moloch&rsquo;

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2king%2023:10&amp;version=NRSV">2
Kings xxiii. 10</a>), and a perpetual fire was kept there to consume
the filth of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>From this horrible Gehenna, with its perpetual fire, its loathsome
worm, its cruelties, has been derived the picture of a never-ending
Hell prepared for the majority of human beings by One who, while they
live on earth, sends the rain and sunshine alike on the evil and the
good. Wo Chang, a Chinaman in London, has written to a journal<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1795src" href="#xd26e1795" name="xd26e1795src">6</a>
his surprise that our religious teachers should be seized with such
concern for the victims of Turkish atrocities in Bulgaria, while they
are so calm in view of the millions burning, and destined to burn
endlessly, in the flames of hell. Our Oriental brothers will learn a
great deal from our missionaries; among other things, that the
theological god of Christendom is still Moloch.</p>
<p>The Ammonites, of whom Moloch was the special demon, appear to have
gradually blended with the Arabians. These received from many sources
their mongrel superstitions, but among them were always prominent the
planet-gods and fire-gods, whom their growing monotheism (to use the
word still in a loose sense) transformed to powerful angels and genii.
The genii of Arabia are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href=
"#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>slaves of the lamp; they are evoked
by burning tufts of hair; they ascend as clouds of smoke. Though, as
subordinate agents of the Fire-fiend, they may be consumed by flames,
yet those who so fight them are apt to suffer a like fate, as in the
case of the Lady of Beauty in the Arabian Nights&rsquo; Entertainments.
Many stories of this kind preceded the declarations of the Old
Testament, that Jehovah breathes fire and brimstone, his breath
kindling Tophet; and also the passages of the Koran, and of the New
Testament describing Satan as a fiery fiend.</p>
<p>Various superstitions connecting infernal powers with fire survive
among the Jews of some remote districts of Europe. The Passover is kept
a week by the Jewish inhabitants in the villages on the Vosges
mountains and on the banks of the Rhine. The time of <i>omer</i> is the
interval between the Passover and Pentecost, the seven weeks elapsing
from the departure from Egypt and the giving of the law, marked in
former days by the offering of an omer of barley daily at the temple.
It is considered a fearful time, during which every Jew is particularly
exposed to the evil influence of evil spirits. There is something
dangerous and fatal in the air; every one should be on the watch, and
not tempt the <i>schedim</i> (demons) in any way. Have a strict eye
upon your cattle, say the Jews, for the sorceress will get into your
stables, mount your cows and goats, bring diseases upon them, and turn
their milk sour. In the latter case, try to lay your hand upon the
suspected person; shut her up in a room with a basin of sour milk, and
beat the milk with a hazel-wand, pronouncing God&rsquo;s name three
times. Whilst you are doing this, the sorceress will make great
lamentation, for the blows are falling upon her. Only stop when you see
blue flames dancing on the surface of the milk, for then the charm is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>broken. If at nightfall a beggar comes to ask for
a little charcoal to light his fire, be very careful not to give it,
and do not let him go without drawing him three times by his coat-tail;
and without losing time, throw some large handfuls of salt on the fire.
In all of which we may trace traditions of parched wildernesses and
fiery serpents, as well as of Abraham&rsquo;s long warfare with the
Fire-worshippers, until, according to the tradition, he was thrown into
the flames he refused to worship.</p>
<p>It is probable that in all the popular superstitions which now
connect devils and future punishments with fire are blended both the
apotheosis and the degradation of demons. The first and most universal
of deities being the Sun, whose earthly representative is fire, the
student of Comparative Mythology has to pick his way very carefully in
tracing by any ethnological path the innumerable superstitions of
European folklore in which Fire-worship is apparently reflected. The
collection of facts and records contained in a work so accessible to
all who care to pursue the subject as that of Brand and his
editors,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1815src" href="#xd26e1815" name=
"xd26e1815src">7</a> renders it unnecessary that I should go into the
curious facts to any great extent here. The uniformity of the
traditions by which the midsummer fires of Northern Europe have been
called Baal-fires or Bel-fires warrant the belief that they are
actually descended from the ancient rites of Baal, even apart from the
notorious fact that they have so generally been accompanied by the
superstition that it is a benefit to children to leap over or be passed
through such fires. That this practice still survives in out-of-the way
places of the British Empire appears from such communications as the
following (from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66"
name="pb66">66</a>]</span><i>Times</i>), which are occasionally
addressed to the London journals:&mdash;&lsquo;<span class=
"sc">Lerwick</span> (Shetland), <i>July 7, 1871</i>.&mdash;<span class=
"sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;It may interest some of your readers to know
that last night (being St. John&rsquo;s Eve, old style) I observed,
within a mile or so of this town, seven bonfires blazing, in accordance
with the immemorial custom of celebrating the Midsummer solstice. These
fires were kindled on various heights around the ancient hamlet of
Sound, and the children leaped over them, and &lsquo;passed through the
fire to Moloch,&rsquo; just as their ancestors would have done a
thousand years ago on the same heights, and their still remoter
progenitors in Eastern lands many thousand years ago. This persistent
adherence to mystic rites in this scientific epoch seems to me worth
taking note of.&mdash;A. J.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To this may be added the following recent extract from a Scotch
journal:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallowe&rsquo;en was celebrated at Balmoral Castle with
unusual ceremony, in the presence of her Majesty, the Princess
Beatrice, the ladies and gentlemen of the royal household, and a large
gathering of the tenantry. The leading features of the celebration were
a torchlight procession, the lighting of large bonfires, and the
burning in effigy of witches and warlocks. Upwards of 150 torch-bearers
assembled at the castle as dark set in, and separated into two parties,
one band proceeding to Invergelder, and the other remaining at
Balmoral. The torches were lighted at a quarter before six
o&rsquo;clock, and shortly after the Queen and Princess Beatrice drove
to Invergelder, followed by the Balmoral party of torchbearers. The two
parties then united and returned in procession to the front of Balmoral
Castle, where refreshments were served to all, and dancing was engaged
in round a huge bonfire. Suddenly there appeared from the rear of the
Castle a grotesque apparition representing a witch with a train of
followers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>dressed like sprites, who danced and gesticulated
in all fashions. Then followed a warlock of demoniac shape, who was
succeeded by another warlock drawing a car, on which was seated the
figure of a witch, surrounded by other figures in the garb of demons.
The unearthly visitors having marched several times round the burning
pile, the principal figure was taken from the car and tossed into the
flames amid the burning of blue lights and a display of crackers and
fireworks. The health of her Majesty the Queen was then pledged, and
drunk with Highland honours by the assembled hundreds. Dancing was then
resumed, and was carried on till a late hour at night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Sixth Council of Constantinople (an. 680), by its sixty-fifth
canon, forbids these fires in the following terms:&mdash;&lsquo;Those
bonefires that are kindled by certain people before their shops and
houses, over which also they use ridiculously to leap, by a certain
ancient custom, we command them from henceforth to cease. Whoever,
therefore, shall do any such thing, if he be a clergyman, let him be
deposed; if he be a layman, let him be excommunicated. For in the
Fourth Book of the Kings it is thus written: And Manasseh built an
altar to all the host of heaven, in the two courts of the Lord&rsquo;s
house, and made his children to pass through the fire.&rsquo; There is
a charming na&iuml;vet&eacute; in this denunciation. It is no longer
doubtful that this &lsquo;bonefire&rsquo; over which people leaped came
from the same source as that Gehenna from which the Church derived the
orthodox theory of hell, as we have already seen. When Shakespeare
speaks (Macbeth) of &lsquo;the primrose way to the everlasting
bonfire,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1839src" href="#xd26e1839"
name="xd26e1839src">8</a> he is, with his wonted felicity, assigning
the flames of hell and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the fires of Moloch and Baal their right
arch&aelig;ological relation.</p>
<p>In my boyhood I have often leaped over a bonfire in a part of the
State of Virginia mainly settled by Scotch families, with whom probably
the custom migrated thither. In the superstitions of the negroes of
that and other Southern States fire plays a large part, but it is
hardly possible now to determine whether they have drifted there from
Africa or England. Sometimes there are queer coincidences between their
notions and some of the early legends of Britain. Thus, the tradition
of the shepherd guided by a distant fire to the entrance of King
Arthur&rsquo;s subterranean hall, where a flame fed by no fuel coming
through the floor reveals the slumbering monarch and his court,
resembles somewhat stories I have heard from negroes of their being led
by distant fires to lucky&mdash;others say unlucky&mdash;or at any rate
enchanted spots. A negro belonging to my father told me that once, as
he was walking on a country road, he saw a great fire in the distance;
he supposed it must be a house on fire, and hastened towards it,
meantime much puzzled, since he knew of no house in that direction. As
he went on his way he turned into a small wood near which the fire
seemed to be, but when he emerged, all he found was a single fire-coal
burning in the path. There were no other traces whatever of fire, but
just then a large dog leaped past him with a loud bark and
disappeared.</p>
<p>In a letter on &lsquo;Voudouism in Virginia,&rsquo; which appeared
in the <i>New York Tribune</i>, dated Richmond, September 17, 1875,
occurs an account of a class of superstitions generally kept close from
the whites, as I have always believed because of their purely African
origin. As will be seen, fire represents an important element in the
superstitious practices. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;If an ignorant negro is smitten with a disease which he
cannot comprehend, he often imagines himself the victim of witchcraft,
and having no faith in &lsquo;white folks&rsquo; physic&rsquo; for such
ailments, must apply to one of these quacks. A physician residing near
this city was invited by such a one to witness his mode of procedure
with a dropsical patient for whom the physician in question had
occasionally charitably prescribed. Curiosity led him to attend the
seance, having previously informed the quack that since the case was in
such hands he relinquished all connection with it. On the coverlet of
the bed on which the sick man lay was spread a quantity of bones,
feathers, and other trash. The charlatan went through with a series of
so-called conjurations, burned feathers, hair, and tiny fragments of
wood in a charcoal furnace, and mumbled gibberish past the
physician&rsquo;s comprehension. He then proceeded to rip open the
pillows and bolsters, and took from them some queer conglomerations of
feathers. These he said had caused all the trouble. Sprinkling a
whitish powder over them, he burnt them in his furnace. A black
offensive smoke was produced, and he announced triumphantly that the
evil influence was destroyed and that the patient would surely get
well. He died not many days later, believing, in common with all his
friends and relatives, that the conjurations of the &lsquo;trick
doctor&rsquo; had failed to save him only because resorted to too
late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following account of a spell from which his wife was rescued,
was given me by a negro in Virginia:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wizard,&rsquo; to quote the exact words of my informant,
&lsquo;threw a stick on a chest; the stick bounded like a trapball
three times; then he opened the chest, took out something looking like
dust or clay, and put it into a cup with water over a fire; then he
poured it over a board (after chopping it three times), which he then
put up <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>beneath the shingles of the house. Returning to
the chest he took a piece of old chain, near the length of my hand,
took a hoe and buried the chain near the sill of the door of my
wife&rsquo;s house where she would pass; then he went away. I saw my
wife coming and called to her not to pass, and to go for a hoe and dig
up the place. She did this, and I took up the chain, which burned the
ends of all my fingers clean off. The same night the conjuror came
back: my wife took two half dollars and a quarter in silver and threw
them on the ground before him. The man seemed as if he was shocked, and
then offered her his hand, which she refused to take, as I had bid her
not to let him touch her. He left and never came to the house again.
The spell was broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am convinced that this is a pure Voudou procedure, and it is
interesting in several regards. The introduction of the chain may have
been the result of the excitement of the time, for it was during the
war when negroes were breaking their chains. The fire and water show
how wide-spread in Africa is that double ordeal which, as we have seen,
is well known in the kingdom of Dahomey.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1871src" href="#xd26e1871" name="xd26e1871src">9</a> But the
mingling of &lsquo;something like dust&rsquo; with the water held in a
cup over the fire, is strongly suggestive of the Jewish method of
preparing holy water, &lsquo;the water of separation.&rsquo; &lsquo;For
an unclean person they shall take of the dust of the burnt heifer of
purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a
vessel.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1874src" href="#xd26e1874"
name="xd26e1874src">10</a> The fiery element of the mixture was in this
case imported with the ashes of the red heifer. As for this sacrifice
of the red heifer itself<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1879src" href=
"#xd26e1879" name="xd26e1879src">11</a> it was plainly the propitiation
of a fiery demon. In Egypt red hair and red animals of all kinds were
considered infernal, and all the details of this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>sacrifice show that the colour of this selected
heifer was typical. The heifer was not a usual sacrifice: a red one was
obviously by its colour marked for the genii of fire&mdash;the terrible
Seven&mdash;and not to be denied them. Its blood was sprinkled seven
times before the tabernacle, and the rest was utterly
consumed&mdash;including the hide, which is particularly
mentioned&mdash;and the ashes taken to make the &lsquo;water of
separation.&rsquo; Calmet notes, in this connection, that the Apis of
India was red-coloured.</p>
<p>The following interesting story of the Chinese Fire-god was supplied
to Mr. Dennys<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1891src" href="#xd26e1891"
name="xd26e1891src">12</a> by Mr. Playfair of H.M. Consulate, to whom
it was related in Peking:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The temples of the God of Fire are numerous in Peking, as is
natural in a city built for the most part of very combustible
materials. The idols representing the god are, with one exception,
decked with red beards, typifying by their colour the element under his
control. The exceptional god has a white beard, and &lsquo;thereby
hangs a tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A hundred years ago the Chinese imperial revenue was in much
better case than it is now. At that time they had not yet come into
collision with Western Powers, and the word &lsquo;indemnity&rsquo; had
not, so far, found a place in their vocabulary; internal rebellions
were checked as soon as they broke out, and, in one word, Kien Lung was
in less embarrassed circumstances than Kwang Hsu; he had more money to
spend, and did lay out a good deal in the way of palaces. His favourite
building, and one on which no expense had been spared, was the
&lsquo;Hall of Contemplation.&rsquo; This hall was of very large
dimensions; the rafters and the pillars which supported the roof were
of a size such as no trees in China furnish now-a-days. They were not
improbably originally sent as an offering by the tributary monarch of
some tropical country, such as Burmah or <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>Siam. Two men could
barely join hands round the pillars; they were cased in lustrous
jet-black lacquer, which, while adding to the beauty of their
appearance, was also supposed to make them less liable to combustion.
Indeed, every care was taken that no fire should approach the building;
no lighted lamp was allowed in the precincts, and to have smoked a pipe
inside those walls would have been punished with death. The floor of
the hall was of different-coloured marbles, in a mosaic of flowers and
mystic Chinese characters, always kept polished like a mirror. The
sides of the room were lined with rare books and precious manuscripts.
It was, in short, the finest palace in the imperial city, and it was
the pride of Kien Lung.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas for the vanity of human wishes! In spite of every
precaution, one night a fire broke out, and the Hall of Contemplation
was in danger. The Chinese of a century ago were not without
fire-engines, and though miserably inefficient as compared with those
of our London fire brigade, they were better than nothing, and a
hundred of them were soon working round the burning building. The
Emperor himself came out to superintend their efforts and encourage
them to renewed exertions. But the hall was doomed; a more than earthly
power was directing the flames, and mortal efforts were of no avail.
For on one of the burning rafters Kien Lung saw the figure of a little
old man, with a long white beard, standing in a triumphant attitude.
&lsquo;It is the God of Fire,&rsquo; said the Emperor, &lsquo;we can do
nothing;&rsquo; so the building was allowed to blaze in peace. Next day
Kien Lung appointed a commission to go the round of the Peking temples
in order to discover in which of them there was a Fire-god with a white
beard, that he might worship him, and appease the offended deity. The
search was fruitless; all the Fire-gods had red beards. But the
commission had done its work badly; being highly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>respectable mandarins of genteel families, they
had confined their search to such temples as were in good repair and of
creditable exterior. Outside the north gate of the imperial city was
one old, dilapidated, disreputable shrine which they had overlooked. It
had been crumbling away for years, and even the dread figure of the God
of Fire, which sat above the altar, had not escaped desecration.
&lsquo;Time had thinned his flowing locks,&rsquo; and the beard had
fallen away altogether. One day some water-carriers who frequented the
locality thought, either in charity or by way of a joke, that the face
would look the better for a new beard. So they unravelled some cord,
and with the frayed-out hemp adorned the beardless chin. An official
passing the temple one day peeped in out of curiosity, and saw the
hempen beard. &lsquo;Just the thing the Emperor was inquiring
about,&rsquo; said he to himself, and he took the news to the palace
without delay. Next day there was a state visit to the dilapidated
temple, and Kien Lung made obeisance and vowed a vow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Fire-god,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;thou hast been wroth with
me in that I have built me palaces, and left thy shrine unhonoured and
in ruins. Here do I vow to build thee a temple surpassed by none other
of the Fire-gods in Peking; but I shall expect thee in future not to
meddle with my palaces.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Emperor was as good as his word. The new temple is on the
site of the old one, and the Fire-god has a flowing beard of fine white
hair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the San Francisco <i>Bulletin</i>, I recently read a description
of the celebration by the Chinese in that city of their Feast for the
Dead, in which there are some significant features. The chief attention
was paid, says the reporter, to a figure &lsquo;representing what
answers in their theology to our devil, and whom they evidently
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>think it necessary to propitiate before proceeding
with their worship over individual graves.&rsquo; This figure is on the
west side of their temple; before and around it candles and joss-sticks
were kept burning. On the east side was the better-looking figure, to
which they paid comparatively little attention.</p>
<p>It was of course but natural that the demons of fire should
gradually be dispelled from that element in its normal aspects, as its
uses became more important through human invention, and its evil
possibilities were mastered. Such demons became gradually located in
the region of especially dangerous fires, as volcanoes and boiling
springs. The Titan whom the ancients believed struggling beneath
&AElig;tna remained there as the Devil in the christian age. St. Agatha
is said to have prevented his vomiting fire for a century by her
prayers. St. Philip ascended the same mountain, and with book and
candle pronounced a prayer of exorcism, at which three devils came out
like fiery flying stones, crying, &lsquo;Woe is us! we are still hunted
by Peter through Philip the Elder!&rsquo; The volcanoes originated the
belief that hell is at the earth&rsquo;s centre, and their busy Vulcans
of classic ages have been easily transformed into sulphurous lords of
the christian Hell. Such is the medi&aelig;val Haborym, demon of arson,
with his three heads&mdash;man, cat, and serpent&mdash;who rides
through the air mounted on a serpent, and bears in his hand a flaming
torch. The astrologers assigned him command of twenty-six legions of
demons in hell, and the superstitious often saw him laughing on the
roofs of burning houses.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1918src" href=
"#xd26e1918" name="xd26e1918src">13</a> But still more dignified is
Raum, who commands <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75"
name="pb75">75</a>]</span>thirty legions, and who destroys villages;
hence, also, concerned in the destructions of war, he became the demon
who awards dignities; and although this made his usual form of
apparition on the right bank of the Rhine that of the Odinistic raven,
on the left bank he may be detected in the little red man who was
reported as the familiar of Napoleon I. during his career.</p>
<p>Among Mr. Gill&rsquo;s South Pacific myths is one of a Prometheus,
Maui, who by assistance of a red pigeon gets from the subterranean
fire-demon the secret of producing fire (by rubbing sticks), the demon
(Mauike) being then consumed with his realm, and fire being brought to
the upper world to remain the friend of man. In Vedic legend, when the
world was enveloped in darkness, the gods prayed to Agni, who suddenly
burst out as Tvashtri&mdash;pure fire, the Vedic Vulcan&mdash;to the
dismay of the universe. In Eddaic sagas, Loki was deemed the most
voracious of beings until defeated in an eating match with Logi
(devouring fire).</p>
<p>Survivals of belief in the fiery nature of demons are very numerous.
Thus it is a very common belief that the Devil cannot touch or cross
water, and may therefore be escaped by leaping a stream. This has
sometimes been supposed to have something to do with the purifying
character of water; but there are many instances in Christian folklore
where the Devil is shown quite independent of even holy water if it is
not sprinkled on him or does not wet his feet. Thus in the Norfolk
legend concerning St. Godric, the Devil is said to have thrown the
vessel with its holy water at the saint&rsquo;s head out of anger at
his singing a canticle which the Virgin taught him. But when the Devil
attacked him in various ferocious animal shapes, St. Godric escaped by
running into the Wear, where he sometimes stood all night in water up
to his neck. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Kobolds get the red jackets they are said to wear from their
fiery nature. Originally the <i>lar familiaris</i> of Germany, the
Kobold became of many varieties; but in one line he has been developed
from the house-spirit, whose good or evil temper was recognised in the
comforts or dangers of fire, to a special Stone-demon. The hell-dog in
Faust&rsquo;s room takes refuge from the spell of
&lsquo;Solomon&rsquo;s Key&rsquo; behind the stone, and is there
transformed to human shape. The German maidens read many pretty oracles
in the behaviour of the fire, and the like in that of its fellow
<span lang="de">Wahrsager</span> the house-dog. It is indeed a
widespread notion that imps and witches lurk about the fireside,
obviously in cat and dog, and ride through the air on implements that
usually stand about the fire,&mdash;shovel, tongs, or broom. In Paris
it was formerly the custom to throw twenty-four cats into the fire on
St. John&rsquo;s night, the animals being, according to M. De Plancy,
emblems of the devil. So was replaced the holocaust of human witches,
until at last civilisation rang out its curfew for all such fires as
that. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=

<p class="first">This old miracle-play of Nature&mdash;the return of
summer flower by flower&mdash;is deciphered from an ancient Assyrian
tablet in a town within only a few hours of another, where a circle of
worshippers repeat the same at every solstice! Myfyr Morganwg, the
Arch-Druid, adores still Hea by name as his Saviour, and at the winter
solstice assembles his brethren to celebrate his coming to bruise the
head of the Serpent of Hades (Annwn, nearly the same as in the tablet),
that seedtime and harvest shall not fail.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1971src" href="#xd26e1971" name="xd26e1971src">2</a></p>
<p>Is this a survival? No doubt; but there is no cult in the world
which, if &lsquo;scratched,&rsquo; as the proverb says, will not reveal
beneath it the same conception. However it may be spiritualised, every
&lsquo;plan of salvation&rsquo; is cast in the mould of Winter
conquered by the Sun, the Descent of Love to the Under World, the
delivery of the imprisoned germs of Life.</p>
<p>It is very instructive to compare with the myth of Ishtar that of
Herm&ouml;dr, seeking the release of Baldur the Beautiful from
Helheim.</p>
<p>The deadly powers of Winter are represented in the Eddaic account of
the death of Baldur, soft summer Light, the Norse Baal. His blind
brother H&ouml;dr is Darkness; the demon who directed his arrow is
Loki, subterranean fire; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>the arrow itself is of mistletoe,
which, fostered by Winter, owes no duty to Baldur; and the realm to
which he is borne is that of Hel, the frozen zone. Herm&ouml;dr, having
arrived, assured Hel that the gods were in despair for the loss of
Baldur. The Queen replied that it should now be tried whether Baldur
was so beloved. &lsquo;If, therefore, all things in the world, both
living and lifeless, weep for him, he shall return to the
&AElig;sir.&rsquo; In the end all wept but the old hag Thokk
(Darkness), who from her cavern sang&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Thokk will wail</p>
<p class="line">With dry eyes</p>
<p class="line">Baldur&rsquo;s bale-fire.</p>
<p class="line">Nought quick or dead</p>
<p class="line">For Carl&rsquo;s son care I.</p>
<p class="line">Let Hel hold her own.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">So Baldur remained in Helheim. The myth very closely
resembles that of Ishtar&rsquo;s Descent. In similar accent the
messenger of the Southern gods weeps and lacerates himself as he
relates the grief of the upper world, and all men and animals
&lsquo;since the time that mother Ishtar descended into Hades.&rsquo;
But in the latter the messenger is successful, in the North he is
unsuccessful. In the corresponding myths of warm and sunny climes the
effort at release is more or less successful, in proportion to the
extent of winter. In Adonis released from Hades for four months every
year, and another four if he chose to abandon Persephone for Aphrodite,
we have a reflection of a variable year. That, and the similar myth of
Persephone, varied in the time specified for their passing in the upper
and under worlds, probably in accordance with the climatic averages of
the regions in which they were told. But in the tropics it was easy to
believe the release complete, as in the myth of Ishtar. In Mangaian
myths the hero, Maui, escapes from a nether world of fire, aided by a
red pigeon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span></p>
<p>When this contest between Winter&rsquo;s Death and Spring&rsquo;s
Life became humanised, it was as Hercules vanquishing Death and
completely releasing Alcestis. When it became spiritualised it was as
Christ conquering Death and Hell, and releasing the spirits from
prison. The wintry desolation had to be artificially imitated in a
forty days&rsquo; fast and Lent, closing with a thrust from the spear
(the mistletoe arrow) amid darkness (blind H&ouml;dr). But the myth of
a swift resurrection had to be artificially preserved in the far North.
The legend of a full triumph over Death and Hell could never have
originated among our Norse ancestors. Their only story resembling it,
that of Iduna, related how her recovery from the Giants brought back
health to the gods, not men. But it was from the South that men had to
hear tidings of a rescue for the earth and man.</p>
<p>We cannot realise now what glad tidings were they which told this
new gospel to peoples sitting in regions of ice and gloom, after it had
been imposed on them against their reluctant fears. In manifold forms
the old combat was renewed in their festivals, and peoples who had long
been prostrate and helpless before the terrible powers of nature were
never weary of the Southern fables of heroic triumphs over them, long
interpreted in the simple physical sense.</p>
<p>The great Demon of the Northern World is still Winter, and the
hereditary hatred of him is such that he is still cursed, scourged,
killed, and buried or drowned under various names and disguises. In
every Slavonic country, says Mr. Ralston, there are to be found, about
carnival time, traces of ancient rites, intended to typify the death of
Winter and the birth of Spring or Summer. In Poland a puppet made of
hemp or straw is flung into a pond or swamp with the words, &lsquo;The
Devil take thee!&rsquo; Then the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>participators in the deed
scamper home, and if one of them stumbles and falls it is believed he
will die within the year. In Upper Lausatia a similar figure is
fastened on a pole to be pelted, then taken to the village boundary and
thrown across it or cast into the water, its bearers returning with
green boughs. Sometimes the figure is shrouded in white, representing
snow, and bears in its hands a broom (the sweeping storm) and a sickle
(the fatal reaper). In Russia the &lsquo;Straw Mujik&rsquo; is burned,
and also in Bulgaria; in the latter the bonfire is accompanied by the
firing of guns, and by dances and songs to Lado, goddess of Spring.
This reminiscence of Leto, on whose account Apollo slew the Python, is
rendered yet more striking by the week of archery which accompanies it,
recalling the sunbeam darts of the god. In Spain and Italy the demon
puppet is scourged under the name of Judas, as indeed is the case in
the annual Good Friday performance of Portuguese sailors in the London
Docks. Mr. Tylor found in Mexico a similar custom, the Judas being a
regular horned and hoofed devil. In Scotland the pre-christian
accessories of a corresponding custom are more pronounced both in the
time selected (the last day of the year, old style) and the place.
&lsquo;The Clavie,&rsquo; as the custom of burning the puppet of Winter
is mysteriously called, occurred on January 12 of this year (1878) at
Burghead, a fishing village near Forres, where stands an old Roman
altar locally named the &lsquo;Douro.&rsquo; A tar-barrel was set on
fire and carried by a fisherman round the town, while the people
shouted and hallooed. (If the man who carries the barrel falls it is an
evil omen.) The lighted barrel, having gone round the town, was carried
to the top of the hill and placed on the Douro. More fuel was added.
The sparks as they fly upwards are supposed to be witches and evil
spirits leaving the town; the people therefore shout at and curse
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>them as they disappear in vacancy. When the
burning tar-barrel falls in pieces, the fishwomen rush in and endeavour
to get a lighted bit of wood from its remains; with this light the fire
on the cottage hearth is at once kindled, and it is considered lucky to
keep this flame alive all the rest of the year. The charcoal of the
Clavie is collected and put in bits up the chimney to prevent the
witches and evil spirits coming into the house. The Douro is covered
with a thick layer of tar from the fires that are annually lighted upon
it. Close to it is a very ancient Roman well.</p>
<p>It is an instance of the irony of etymology that the word
&lsquo;Hell&rsquo; means a place of fireless darkness. Nor is the fact
that the name of the Scandinavian demoness Hel, phonetically
corresponding with Kali, &lsquo;the Black One&rsquo; (Goth. Halja),
whose abode was an icy hole, has her name preserved as a place of fiery
torment, without significance. In regions where cold was known to an
uncomfortable extent as well as heat, we usually find it represented in
the ideas of future punishment. The realm called Hades, meaning just
the same as Hell, suggests cold. Tertullian and Jerome say that
Christ&rsquo;s own phrases &lsquo;outer darkness&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;gnashing (chattering) of teeth&rsquo; suggest a place of extreme
cold alternating with the excessive heat. Traces of similar
speculations are found with the Rabbins. Thus Rabbi Joseph says Gehenna
had both water and fire. Noah saw the angel of death approaching and
hid from him twelve months. Why twelve? Because (explains Rabbi Jehuda)
such is the trial of sinners,&mdash;six in water, six in fire. Dante
(following Virgil) has frigid as well as burning hells; and the idea
was refined by some scholiasts to a statement which would seem to make
the alternations of future punishment amount to a severe ague and
fever. Milton (Paradise Lost, ii.) has blended the rabbinical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=

(<span lang="la">De P&oelig;nis Inferni</span>) says the severest of

satisfy his hunger. The Chenoos (demons) of the Mimacs of Nova Scotia
present certain features of the race-demons, but are fearfully cold.
The Chenoo weapon is a dragon&rsquo;s horn, his yell is fatal to the
hearer, his heart is a block of ice. This heart must be destroyed if
the demon is to be slain, but it can only be done by melting in the
fire: the chief precaution required is that one is not drowned in the
flood so caused. The icy demon survived long in Scotland. Sir James
Melville, in his &lsquo;Memoirs,&rsquo; says &lsquo;the spirit or devil
that helped the Scottish witches to raise a storm in the sea of Norway
was cold as ice and his body hard as iron; his face was terrible, his
nose like the beak of an eagle, great burning eyes, his hands and legs
hairy, with claws on his nails like a griffin.&rsquo; Dr. Fian was
burnt for raising this demon to oppose James I. on his stormy passage
from Denmark.</p>
<p>This type of demon haunted people&rsquo;s minds in Scandinavia,
where, though traditions of a flame demon (Loki) and the end of the
world by fire were imported, the popular belief seems to have been
mainly occupied with Frost giants, and the formidable Oegir, god of the
bleak sea east winds, preserved in our word awe (Anglo-Saxon
<i>ege</i>), and more directly in the name of our familiar demon, the
Ogre, so often slain in the child&rsquo;s Gladsheim. Loki (fire) was,
indeed, speedily relegated by the &AElig;sir (gods) to a hidden
subterraneous realm, where his existence could only be known by the
earthquakes, geysers, and Hecla eruptions which he occasioned. Yet he
was to come forth at Ragnar&ouml;k, the Twilight of the Gods. We can
see a singular blending of tropical and frigid zones&mdash;the one
traditional, the other native&mdash;in the Prose Edda.
Thus:&mdash;&lsquo;What will remain,&rsquo; said Gangler, &lsquo;after
heaven and earth and the whole universe shall be consumed, and after
all the gods and the homes of Valhalla and all mankind shall have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=

abodes,&rsquo; replied Thridi, &lsquo;some good, some bad. The best
place of all to be in will be Gimil, in heaven; and all who delight in
quaffing good drink will find a great store in the hall called Brimir,
which is also in heaven in the region Okolni. There is also a fair hall
of ruddy gold, (for) Sindri, which stands on the mountains of Nida. In
those halls righteous and well-minded men shall abide. In
N&aacute;-str&ouml;nd there is a vast and direful structure with doors
that face the north. It is formed entirely of the backs of serpents,
wattled together like wicker-work. But the serpents&rsquo; heads are
turned towards the inside of the hall, and continually vomit forth
floods of venom, in which wade all those who commit murder or who
forswear themselves. As it is said in the

(<i>g&iacute;mr</i>): Brimir (<i>br&iacute;mi</i>, flame), the giant,
and Sindri (<i>cinder</i>), the dwarf, jeweller of the gods, are raised
to halls of gold. Nothing is said of a garden, or walking therein
&lsquo;in the cool of the day.&rsquo; On the other hand,
N&aacute;-str&ouml;nd means Strand of the Dead, in that region whose
&lsquo;doors face the north,<a id="xd26e2107" name="xd26e2107"></a> far

Christianity has not availed to give the Icelanders any demonic name
suggestive of fire. They speak of &lsquo;Skratti&rsquo; (the roarer,
perhaps our Old Scratch), and &lsquo;Kolski&rsquo; (the coal black
one), but promise nothing so luminous and comfortable as fire or
fire-fiend to the evil-doer.</p>
<p>In the great Epic of the <i lang="de">Nibelungen Lied</i> we have
probably the shape in which the Northman&rsquo;s dream of Paradise
finally cohered,&mdash;a Rose-garden in the South, guarded by a huge
Worm (water-snake, or glittering glacial sea intervening), whose
glowing charms, with Beauty (Chriemhild) for their queen, could be won
only by a brave dragon-slaying Siegfried. In passing by the pretty
lakeside home of Richard Wagner, on my way to witness the Ammergau
version of another dragon-binding and paradise-regaining legend, I
noted that the old name of the (Starnberg) lake was <i>Wurmsee</i>,
from the dragon that once haunted it, while from the composer&rsquo;s
window might be seen its &lsquo;Isle of Roses,&rsquo; which the dragon
guarded. Since then the myth of many forms has had its musical
apotheosis at Bayreuth under his wand.</p>
<p>England, partly perhaps on account of its harsh climate, once had
the reputation of being the chief abode of demons. A demoness leaving
her lover on the Continent says, &lsquo;My mother is calling me in
England.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2121src" href="#xd26e2121"
name="xd26e2121src">5</a> But England assigned them still higher
latitudes; in christianising Ireland, Iona, and other islands far
north, it was preliminary to expel the demons. &lsquo;The
Clavie,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Deis-iuil&rsquo; of Lewis and other Hebrides
islands&mdash;fire carried round cattle to defend them from demons, and
around mothers not yet churched, to keep the babes from being
&lsquo;changed&rsquo;&mdash;show that the expulsion still goes on,
though in such regions Norse and christian notions have become so
jumbled that it is &lsquo;fighting the devil with fire.&rsquo; So in
the Havamal men <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>are warned to invoke &lsquo;fire for
distempers;&rsquo; and Gudrun sings&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Raise, ye Jarls, an oaken pile;</p>
<p class="line">Let it under heaven the lightest be.</p>
<p class="line">May it burn a breast full of woes!</p>
<p class="line">The fire round my heart its sorrows melt.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The last line is in contrast with the Hindu saying,
&lsquo;the flame of her husband&rsquo;s pyre cools the widow&rsquo;s
breast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The characters of the Northern Heaven and Hell survive in the
English custom of burying the dead on the southern side of a church.
How widely this usage prevailed in Brand&rsquo;s time may be seen by
reference to his chapter on churchyards. The north side of the
graveyard was set apart for unbaptized infants and executed criminals,
and it was permitted the people to dance or play tennis in that part.
Dr. Lee says that in the churchyard at Morwenstow the southern portion
only contains graves, the north part being untenanted; as the Cornish
believe (following old traditions) that the north is the region of
demons. In some parishes of Cornwall when a baptism occurs the north
door of the nave opposite the font is thrown open, so that the devil
cast out may retire to his own region, the north.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2139src" href="#xd26e2139" name="xd26e2139src">6</a> This accords
with the saying in Martin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Month&rsquo;s
Mind&rsquo;&mdash;<i lang="la">ab aquilone omne malum</i>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not improbable that the fact noted by White, in his
&lsquo;History of Selborne,&rsquo; that &lsquo;the usual approach to
most country churches is by the south,&rsquo; indicated a belief that
the sacred edifice should turn its back on the region of demons. It is
a singular instance of survival which has brought about the fact that
people who listen devoutly to sermons describing the fiery character of
Satan and his abode should surround the very churches in which those
sermons are heard with evidences of their lingering <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>faith
that the devil belongs to the region of ice, and that their dead must
be buried in the direction of the happy abodes of Brimir and
Sindri,&mdash;Fire and Cinders!</p>
<p>M. Fran&ccedil;ois Lenormant has written an extremely instructive
chapter in comparison of the Accadian and the Finnish mythologies. He
there shows that they are as one and the same tree, adapted to
antagonistic climates.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2154src" href=
"#xd26e2154" name="xd26e2154src">7</a> With similar triad, runes,
charms, and even names in some cases, their regard for the fire
worshipped by both varies in a way that seems at first glance somewhat
anomalous. The Accadians in their fire-worship exhausted the resources
of praise in ascription of glory and power to the flames; the Finns in
their cold home celebrated the fire festival at the winter solstice,
uttered invocations over the fire, and the mother of the family, with
her domestic libation, said: &lsquo;Always rise so high, O my flame,
but burn not larger nor more ardent!&rsquo; This diminution of
enthusiasm in the Northern fire-worshipper, as compared with the
Southern, may only be the result of euphemism in the latter; or perhaps
while the formidable character of the fire-god among the primitive
Assyrians is indicated in the utter prostration before him
characteristic of their litanies and invocations, in the case of the
Finns the perpetual presence of the more potent cold led to the less
excessive adoration. These ventured to recognise the faults of
fire.</p>
<p>The true nature of this anomaly becomes visible when we consider
that the great demon, dreaded by the two countries drawing their cult
from a common source, represented the excess of the power most dreaded.
The demon in each case was a wind; among the Finns the north wind,
among the Accadians the south-west (the most fiery) wind. The Finnish
demon was Hiisi, speeding on his pale horse <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>through
the air, with a terrible train of monster dogs, cats, furies,
scattering pain, disease, and death.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2164src" href="#xd26e2164" name="xd26e2164src">8</a> The Accadian
demon, of which the bronze image is in the Louvre, is the body of a
dog, erect on eagle&rsquo;s feet, its arms pointed with lion&rsquo;s
paws; it has the tail of a scorpion and the head of a skeleton, half
stripped of flesh, preserving the eyes, and mounted with the horns of a
goat. It has four outspread wings. On the back of this ingeniously
horrible image is an inscription in the Accadian language, apprising us
that it is the demon of the south-west wind, made to be placed at the
door or window, to avert its hostile action.</p>
<p>As we observe such figures as these on the one hand, and on the
other the fair beings imagined to be antagonistic to them; as we note
in runes and incantations how intensely the ancients felt themselves to
be surrounded by these good and evil powers, and, reading nature so,
learned to see in the seasons successively conquering and conquered by
each other, and alternation of longer days and longer nights, the
changing fortunes of a never-ending battle; we may better realise the
meaning of solstitial festivals, the customs that gathered around
Yuletide and New Year, and the manifold survivals from them which
annually masquerade in Christian costume and names. To our
sun-worshipping ancestor the new year meant the first faint advantage
of the warmer time over winter, as nearly as he could fix it. The
hovering of day between superiority of light and darkness is now named
after doubting Thomas. At Yuletide the dawning victory of the sun is
seen as a holy infant in a manger amid beasts of the stall. The old
nature-worship has bequeathed to christian belief a close-fitting
mantle. But the old idea of a war between the wintry and the warm
powers still haunts the period of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90"
href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>the New Year; and the twelve
days and nights, once believed to be the period of a fiercely-contested
battle between good and evil demons, are still regarded by many as a
period for especial watchfulness and prayer. New Year&rsquo;s Eve, in
the north of England still &lsquo;Hogmanay,&rsquo;&mdash;probably O. N.
<i>h&ouml;ku-n&ouml;tt</i>, midwinter-night, when the sacrifices of
Thor were prepared,&mdash;formerly had many observances which reflected
the belief that good and evil ghosts were contending for every man and
woman: the air was believed to be swarming with them, and watch must be
kept to see that the protecting fire did not go out in any household;
that no strange man, woman, or animal approached,&mdash;possibly a
demon in disguise. Sacred plants were set in doors and windows to
prevent the entrance of any malevolent being from the multitudes
filling the air. John Wesley, whose noble heart was allied with a mind
strangely open to stories of hobgoblins, led the way of churches and
sects back into this ancient atmosphere. Nevertheless, the rationalism
of the age has influenced St. Wesley&rsquo;s Feast&mdash;Watchnight. It
can hardly recognise its brother in the Boar&rsquo;s Head Banquet of
Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, which celebrated victory over tusky
winter, the decapitated demon whose bristles were once icicles fallen
beneath the sylvan spirits of holly and rosemary. Yet what the
Watchnight really signifies in the antiquarian sense is just that old
culminating combat between the powers of fire and frost, once believed
to determine human fates. In White Russia, on New Year&rsquo;s Day,
when the annual elemental battle has been decided, the killed and
wounded on one hand, and the fortunate on the other, are told by
carrying from house to house the rich and the poor Kolyadas. These are
two children, one dressed in fine attire, and crowned with a wreath of
full ears of grain, the other ragged, and wearing a wreath of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>threshed straw. These having been closely covered,
each householder is called in, and chooses one. If his choice chances
upon the &lsquo;poor Kolyada,&rsquo; the attending chorus chant a
mournful strain, in which he is warned to expect a bad harvest,
poverty, and perhaps death; if he selects the &lsquo;rich
Kolyada,&rsquo; a cheerful song is sung promising him harvest, health,
and wealth.</p>
<p>The natives of certain districts of Dardistan assign political and
social significance to their Feast of Fire, which is celebrated in the
month preceding winter, at new moon, just after their meat provision
for the season is laid in to dry. Their legend is, that it was then
their national hero slew their ancient tyrant and introduced good
government. This legend, related elsewhere, is of a tyrant slain
through the discovery that his heart was made of snow. He was slain by
the warmth of torches. In the celebrations all the men of the villages
go forth with torches, which they swing round their heads, and throw in
the direction of Ghilgit, where the snow-hearted tyrant so long held
his castle. When the husbands return home from their torch-throwing a
little drama is rehearsed. The wives refuse them entrance till they
have entreated, recounting the benefits they have brought them; after
admission the husband affects sulkiness, and must be brought round with
caresses to join in the banquet. The wife leads him forward with this
song:&mdash;&lsquo;Thou hast made me glad, thou favourite of the Rajah!
Thou hast rejoiced me, oh bold horseman! I am pleased with thee who so
well usest the gun and sword! Thou hast delighted me, oh thou invested
with a mantle of honours! Oh great happiness, I will buy it by giving
pleasure&rsquo;s price! Oh thou nourishment to us, heap of corn, store
of ghee&mdash;delighted will I buy it all by giving pleasure&rsquo;s
price!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=

<p class="first">During some recent years curious advertisements have
appeared in a journal of Edinburgh, calling for pious persons to occupy
certain hours of the night with holy exercises. It would appear that
they refer to a band of prayerful persons who provide that there shall
be an unbroken round of prayers during every moment of the day and
night. Their theory is, that it is the usual cessation of christian
prayers at night which causes so many disasters. The devils being then
less restrained, raise storms and all elemental perils. The praying
circle, which hopes to bind these demons by an uninterrupted chain of
prayers, originated, as I am informed, in the pious enthusiasm of a
lady whose kindly solicitude in some pre-existent sister was no doubt
personified in the Hindu Munasa, who, while all gods slept, sat in the
shape of a serpent on a branch of Euphorbia to preserve mankind from
the venom of snakes. It is to be feared, however, that it is hardly the
wisdom of the serpent which is on prayerful watch at Edinburgh, but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>rather a vigilance of that perilous kind which was
exercised by &lsquo;Meggie o&rsquo; the Shore,&rsquo; anno 1785, as
related by Hugh Miller.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2195src" href=
"#xd26e2195" name="xd26e2195src">1</a> On a boisterous night, when two
young girls had taken refuge in her cottage, they all heard about
midnight cries of distress mingling with the roar of the sea,
&lsquo;Raise the window curtain and look out,&rsquo; said Meggie. The
terrified girls did so, and said, &lsquo;There is a bright light in the
middle of the Bay of Udall. It hangs over the water about the height of
a ship&rsquo;s mast, and we can see something below it like a boat
riding at anchor, with the white sea raging around her.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Now drop the curtain,&rsquo; said Meggie; &lsquo;I am no
stranger, my lasses, to sights and noises like these&mdash;sights and
noises of another world; but I have been taught that God is nearer to
me than any spirit can be; and so have learned not to be afraid.&rsquo;
Afterwards it is not wonderful that a Cromarty yawl was discovered to
have foundered, and all on board to have been drowned; though
Meggie&rsquo;s neighbours seemed to have preserved the legend after her
faith, and made the scene described a premonition of what actually
occurred. It was in a region where mariners when becalmed invoke the
wind by whistling; and both the whistling and the praying, though their
prospects in the future may be slender, have had a long career in the
past.</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Rig-Veda&rsquo; there is a remarkable hymn to Rudra
(the Roarer), which may be properly quoted here:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. Sire of the storm gods, let thy favour extend to us; shut us not
out from the sight of the sun; may our hero be successful in the
onslaught. O Rudra, may we wax mighty in our offspring.</p>
<p>2. Through the assuaging remedies conferred by thee, O Rudra, may we
reach a hundred winters; drive away far from us hatred, distress, and

<p>3. Thou, O Rudra, art the most excellent of beings in glory, the
strongest of the strong, O wielder of the bolt; bear us safely through
evil to the further shore; ward off all the assaults of sin.</p>
<p>4. May we not provoke thee to anger, O Rudra, by our adorations,
neither through faultiness in praises, nor through wantonness in
invocations; lift up our heroes by thy remedies; thou art, I hear, the
chief physician among physicians.</p>
<p>5. May I propitiate with hymns this Rudra who is worshipped with
invocations and oblations; may the tender-hearted, easily-entreated,
tawny-haired, beautiful-chinned god not deliver us up to the plotter of
evil [literally, to the mind meditating &lsquo;I kill&rsquo;].</p>
<p>6. The bounteous giver, escorted by the storm-gods, hath gladdened
me, his suppliant, with most invigorating food; as one distressed by
heat seeketh the shade, may I, free from harm, find shelter in the
good-will of Rudra.</p>
<p>7. Where, O Rudra, is that gracious hand of thine, which is healing
and comforting? Do thou, removing the evil which cometh from the gods,
O bounteous giver, have mercy upon me.</p>
<p>8. To the tawny, the fair-complexioned dispenser of bounties, I send
forth a great and beautiful song of praise; adore the radiant god with
prostrations; we hymn the illustrious name of Rudra.</p>
<p>9. Sturdy-limbed, many-shaped, fierce, tawny, he hath decked himself
with brilliant ornaments of gold; truly strength is inseparable from
Rudra, the sovereign of this vast world.</p>
<p>10. Worthy of worship, thou bearest the arrows and the bow; worthy
of worship, thou wearest a resplendent necklace of many forms; worthy
of worship, thou rulest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>over this immense universe; there is
none, O Rudra, mightier than thou.</p>
<p>11. Celebrate the renowned and ever-youthful god who is seated on a
chariot, who is, like a wild beast, terrible, fierce, and destructive;
have mercy upon the singer, O Rudra, when thou art praised; may thy
hosts strike down another than us.</p>
<p>12. As a boy saluteth his father who approacheth and speaketh to
him, so, O Rudra, I greet thee, the giver of much, the lord of the
good; grant us remedies when thou art praised.</p>
<p>13. Your remedies, O storm-gods, which are pure and helping, O
bounteous givers, which are joy-conferring, which our father Manu
chose, these and the blessing and succour of Rudra I crave.</p>
<p>14. May the dart of Rudra be turned aside from us, may the great
malevolence of the flaming-god be averted; unbend thy strong bow from
those who are liberal with their wealth; O generous god, have mercy
upon our offspring and our posterity (<i>i.e.</i>, our children and
children&rsquo;s children).</p>
<p>15. Thus, O tawny Rudra, wise giver of gifts, listen to our cry,
give heed to us here, that thou mayest not be angry with us, O god, nor
slay us; may we, rich in heroic sons, utter great praise at the
sacrifice.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2237src" href="#xd26e2237" name=
"xd26e2237src">2</a></p>
<p>In other hymns the malevolent character of Rudra is made still more
prominent:&mdash;</p>
<p>7. Slay not our strong man nor our little child, neither him who is
growing nor him who is grown, neither our father nor our mother; hurt
not, O Rudra, our dear selves.</p>
<p>8. Harm us not in our children and children&rsquo;s children, nor in
our men, nor in our kine, nor in our horses. Smite <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>not our
heroes in thy wrath; we wait upon thee perpetually with
offerings.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2249src" href="#xd26e2249" name=

<p>In this hymn (verse 1) Rudra is described as &lsquo;having braided
hair;&rsquo; and in the &lsquo;Yajur-veda&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Atharva-veda&rsquo; other attributes of Siva are ascribed to
him, such as the epithet <i>n&icirc;la-gr&icirc;va</i>, or blue-necked.
In the &lsquo;Rig-veda&rsquo; Siva occurs frequently as an epithet, and
means <i>auspicious</i>. It was used as a euphemistic epithet to
appease Rudra, the lord of tempests; and finally, the epithet developed
into a distinct god.</p>
<p>The parentage of Siva is further indicated in the legends that his
glance destroyed the head of the youthful deity Ganesa, who now wears
the elephant head, with which it was replaced; and that the gods
persuaded him to keep his eyes perpetually winking (like
sheet-lightning), lest his concentrated look (the thunderbolt) should
reduce the universe to ashes. With the latter legend the gaze of the
evil eye in India might naturally be associated, though in the majority
of countries this was rather associated with the malign influences
ascribed to certain planets, especially Saturn; the charms against the
evil eye being marked over with zodiacal signs. The very myth of
Siva&rsquo;s eye survives in the Russian demon Magarko
(&lsquo;Winker&rsquo;) and the Servian Vii, whose glance is said to
have power to reduce men, and even cities, to ashes.</p>
<p>The terrible Rudra is represented in a vast number of beliefs, some
of them perhaps survivals; in the rough sea and east-wind demon Oegir
of the northern world, and Typhon in the south; and in Luther&rsquo;s
faith that &lsquo;devils do house in the dense black clouds, and send
storms, hail, thunder and lightning, and poison the air with their
infernal stench,&rsquo; a doctrine which Burton, the Anatomist of
Melancholy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>too, maintained against the meteorologists of his
time.</p>
<p>Among the ancient Aryans lightning seems to have been the supreme
type of divine destructiveness. Rudra&rsquo;s dart, Siva&rsquo;s eye,
reappear with the Singhalese prince of demons Wessamonny, described as
wielding a golden sword, which, when he is angry, flies out of his
hand, to which it spontaneously returns, after cutting off a thousand
heads.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2268src" href="#xd26e2268" name=
"xd26e2268src">4</a> A wonderful spear was borne by Odin, and was
possibly the original Excalibur. The four-faced Sviatevit of Russia,
whose mantle has fallen to St. George, whose statue was found at Zbrucz
in 1851, bore a horn of wine (rain) and a sword (lightning).</p>
<p>In Greece similar swords were wielded by Zeus, and also by the god
of war. Through Zeus and Ares, the original wielders of the
lightning&mdash;Indra and Siva&mdash;became types of many gods and
semi-divine heroes. The evil eye of Siva glared from the forehead of
the Cyclopes, forgers of thunderbolts; and the saving disc of Indra
flashed in the swords and arrows of famous
dragon-slayers&mdash;Perseus, Pegasus, Hercules, and St. George. The
same sword defended the Tree of Life in Eden, and was borne in the hand
of Death on the Pale Horse (a white horse was sacrificed to Sviatevit
in Russia within christian times). And, finally, we have the wonderful
sword which obeys the command &lsquo;Heads off!&rsquo; delighting all
nurseries by the service it does to the King of the Golden
Mountain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven.&rsquo; To
the Greeks this falling of rebellious deities out of heaven accounted,
as we have seen explained, for their lameness. But a universal
phenomenon can alone account for the many demons with crooked or
crippled legs (like &lsquo;Diable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"

all around the world. The Namaquas of South Africa have a
&lsquo;deity&rsquo; whose occupation it is to cause pain and death; his
name is Tsui&rsquo;knap, that is &lsquo;wounded knee.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2283src" href="#xd26e2283" name="xd26e2283src">6</a>
Livingstone says of the Bakwains, another people of South Africa,
&lsquo;It is curious that in all their pretended dreams or visions of
their god he has always a crooked leg, like the Egyptian
Thau.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2286src" href="#xd26e2286"
name="xd26e2286src">7</a> In Mainas, South America, they believe in a
treacherous demon, Uchuella-chaqui, or Lame-foot, who in dark forests
puts on a friendly shape to lure Indians to destruction; but the
huntsmen say they can never be deceived if they examine this
demon&rsquo;s foot-track, because of the unequal size of the two
feet.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2289src" href="#xd26e2289" name=
"xd26e2289src">8</a> The native Australians believed in a demon named
Biam; he is black and deformed in his lower extremities; they

evidence that these superstitions migrated from a common centre; and
there can be little doubt that many of these crooked legs are traceable
to the crooked lightning.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2299src" href=
"#xd26e2299" name="xd26e2299src">10</a> At the same time this is by no
means inconsistent with what has been already said of the fall of
Titans and angels from heaven as often accounting for their lameness in
popular myths. But in such details it is hard to reach certainty, since
so many of the facts bear a suspicious resemblance to each other. A
wild boar with &lsquo;distorted legs&rsquo; attacked St. Godric, and
the temptation is strong to generalise on the story, but the legs
probably mean only to certify that it was the devil.</p>
<p>Dr. Schliemann has unearthed among his other treasures the
remarkable fact that a temple of Helios (the sun) once stood near the
site of the present Church of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>Elias, at Mycen&aelig;, which has
from time immemorial been the place to which people repair to pray for
rain.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2306src" href="#xd26e2306" name=
"xd26e2306src">11</a> When the storm-breeding Sun was succeeded by the
Prophet whose prayer evoked the cloud, even the name of the latter did
not need to be changed. The discovery is the more interesting because
it has always been a part of the christian folklore of that region
that, when a storm with lightning occurs, it is &lsquo;Elias in his
chariot of fire.&rsquo; A similar phrase is used in some part of every
Aryan country, with variation of the name: it is Woden, or King
Waldemar, or the Grand Veneur, or sometimes God, who is said to be
going forth in his chariot.</p>
<p>These storm-demons in their chariots have their forerunner in Vata
or Vayu, the subject of one of the most beautiful Vedic hymns. &lsquo;I
celebrate the glory of Vata&rsquo;s chariot; its noise comes rending
and resounding. Touching the sky he moves onward, making all things
ruddy; and he comes propelling the dust of the earth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Soul of the gods, source of the universe, this deity moves as
he lists. His sounds have been heard, but his form is not seen; this
Vata let us worship with an oblation.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2316src" href="#xd26e2316" name="xd26e2316src">12</a></p>
<p>This last verse, as Mr. Muir has pointed out, bears a startling
resemblance to the passage in John, &lsquo;The Wind bloweth where it
listeth, and thou canst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth;
so is every one that is born of the Wind.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2321src" href="#xd26e2321" name="xd26e2321src">13</a></p>
<p>But an equally striking development of the Vedic idea is represented
in the Siamese legend of Buddha, and in this case the Vedic Wind-god
Vayu reappears by name for the Angels of Tempests, or Loka Phayu. The
first <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>portent which preceded the descent of Buddha
from the Tushita heavens was when the Angels of the Tempest, clothed in
red garments, and with streaming hair, travel among the abodes of
mankind crying, &lsquo;Attend all ye who are near to death; repent and
be not heedless! The end of the world approaches, but one hundred
thousand years more and it will be destroyed. Exert yourselves, then,
exert yourselves to acquire merit. Above all things be charitable;
abstain from doing evil; meditate with love to all beings, and listen
to the teachings of holiness. For we are all in the mouth of the king
of death. Strive then earnestly for meritorious fruits, and seek that
which is good.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2331src" href=
"#xd26e2331" name="xd26e2331src">14</a></p>
<p>Not less remarkable is the Targum of Jonathan Ben Uzziel to 1 Kings
xix., where around Elias on the mountain gather &lsquo;a host of angels
of the wind, cleaving the mountain and breaking the rocks before the
Lord;&rsquo; and after these, &lsquo;angels of commotion,&rsquo; and
next &lsquo;of fire,&rsquo; and, finally, &lsquo;voices singing in
silence&rsquo; preceded the descent of Jehovah. It can hardly be
wondered that a prophet of whom this story was told, and that of the
storm evoked from a small cloud, should be caught up into that chariot
of the Vedic Vayu which has rolled on through all the ages of
mythology.</p>
<p>Mythologic streams seem to keep their channels almost as steadfastly
as rivers, but as even these change at last or blend, so do the old
traditions. Thus we find that while Thor and Odin remain as separate in
survivals as Vayu and Parjanya in India, in Russia Elias has inherited
not the mantle of the wind-god or storm-breeding sun, but of the
Slavonic Thunderer Perun. There is little doubt that this is Parjanya,
described in the &lsquo;Rig-Veda&rsquo; as &lsquo;the thunderer, the
showerer, the bountiful,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2338src"
href="#xd26e2338" name="xd26e2338src">15</a> who &lsquo;strikes down
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=

&lsquo;The people of Novgorod,&rsquo; says Herberstein, &lsquo;formerly
offered their chief worship and adoration to a certain idol named
Perun. When subsequently they received baptism they removed it from its
place, and threw it into the river Volchov; and the story goes that it
swam against the stream, and that near the bridge a voice was heard
saying, &lsquo;This for you, O inhabitants of Novgorod, in memory of
me;&rsquo; and at the same time a certain rope was thrown upon the
bridge. Even now it happens from time to time on certain days of the
year that this voice of Perun may be heard, and on these occasions the
citizens run together and lash each other with ropes, and such a tumult
arises <span class="corr" id="xd26e2343" title=
"Source: thereform">therefrom</span> that all the efforts of the
governor can scarcely assuage it.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2346src" href="#xd26e2346" name="xd26e2346src">16</a> The statue
of Perun in Kief, says Mr. Ralston, had a trunk of wood, while the head
was of silver, with moustaches of gold, and among its weapons was a
mace. Afanasief states that in White-Russian traditions Perun is tall
and well-shaped, with black hair and a long golden beard. This beard
relates him to Barbarossa, and, perhaps, though distantly, with the
wood-demon Barbatos, the Wild Archer, who divined by the songs of
birds.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2349src" href="#xd26e2349" name=
"xd26e2349src">17</a> Perun also has a bow which is &lsquo;sometimes
identified with the rainbow, an idea which is known also to the Finns.
From it, according to the White Russians, are shot burning arrows,
which set on fire all things that they touch. In many parts of Russia
(as well as of Germany) it is supposed that these bolts sink deep into
the soil, but that at the end of three or seven years they return to
the surface in the shape of longish stones of a black or dark grey
colour&mdash;probably belemnites, or masses of fused sand&mdash;which
are called thunderbolts, and considered as excellent preservations
against lightning and conflagrations. The Finns call them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>Ukonkiwi&mdash;the stone of thunder-god Ukko,
and in Courland their name is Perkuhnsteine, which explains itself. In
some cases the flaming dart of Perun became, in the imagination of the
people, a golden key. With it he unlocked the earth, and brought to
light its concealed treasures, its restrained waters, its captive
founts of light. With it also he locked away in safety fugitives who
wished to be put out of the power of malignant conjurors, and performed
various other good offices. Appeals to him to exercise these functions
still exist in the spells used by the peasants, but his name has given
way to that of some christian personage. In one of them, for instance,
the Archangel Michael is called upon to secure the invoker behind an
iron door fastened by twenty-seven locks, the keys of which are given
to the angels to be carried to heaven. In another, John the Baptist is
represented as standing upon a stone in the Holy Sea [<i>i.e.</i>, in
heaven], resting upon an iron crook or staff, and is called upon to
stay the flow of blood from a wound, locking the invoker&rsquo;s veins
&lsquo;with his heavenly key.&rsquo; In this case the myth has passed
into a rite. In order to stay a violent bleeding from the nose, a
locked padlock is brought, and the blood is allowed to drop through its
aperture, or the sufferer grasps a key in each hand, either plan being
expected to prove efficacious. As far as the key is concerned, the
belief seems to be still maintained among ourselves.&rsquo;<a class=

<p>The Key has a holy sense in various religions, and consequently an
infernal key is its natural counterpart. The Vedic hymns, which say so
much about the shutting and opening, imprisoning and releasing, of
heavenly rains and earthly fruits by demons and deities, interpret many
phenomena of nature, and the same ideas have arisen in many lands. We
cannot be certain, therefore, that Calmet <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>is right in assigning
an Indian origin to the subjoined Figure 5, an ancient Persian medal.
The signs of the zodiac on its body show it to be one of those
celestial demons believed able to bind the beneficent or loose the
formidable powers of nature. The Key is of especial import in Hebrew
faith. It was the high-priest Eliakim&rsquo;s symbol of office, as
being also prefect in the king&rsquo;s house. &lsquo;The key of the
house of David will I lay upon his shoulder: he shall open and none
shall shut; he shall shut and none shall open.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2370src" href="#xd26e2370" name="xd26e2370src">19</a> The
Rabbins had a saying that God reserves to himself four keys, which he

key of the grave, the key of fruitfulness, and the key of barrenness.
It was the sign of one set above angels when Christ was seen with the
keys of Hell and Death, or when he delivered the keys of heaven to
Peter,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2377src" href="#xd26e2377" name=

<p>The ubiquitous superstition which attributes the flint arrows of
pre-historic races to gods, shot by them as lightning, and, as some
said, from a rainbow, is too childlike a theory to call for elaborate
treatment. We need not, ethnographically, connect our &lsquo;Thor
arrows&rsquo; and &lsquo;Elf shots&rsquo; with the stones hurled at
mortals by the Thunder-Duke (Lui-tsz) of China. The ancient Parthians,
who used to reply to the thunderstorm by shooting arrows at it, and the
Turks, who attack an eclipse with guns, fairly represent the infancy of
the human race, though perhaps with more than its average pluck. Dr.
Macgowan relates, concerning the Lei-chau (Thunder District) of China,
various myths which resemble those which surround the world. After
thunderstorms, black stones, it is believed, may be found which emit
light and peculiar sounds on being struck. In a temple consecrated to
the Thunder Duke the people annually place a drum for that stormy demon
to beat. The drum was formerly left on a mountain-top with a little boy
as a sacrifice.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2387src" href="#xd26e2387"

the belief in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>the same country that violent winds and typhoons
are caused by the passage through the air of the &lsquo;Bob-tailed
Dragon,&rsquo; and also of the rain-god Y&uuml;-Sh&uuml;h. A storm-god
connected with the &lsquo;Eagre,&rsquo; or bore of the river
Tsien-tang, presents a coincidence of name with the Scandinavian Oegir,
which would be hardly noticeable were it not for the very close
resemblance between the folklore concerning the &lsquo;Bob-tailed
Dragon&rsquo; and the storm-dragons of several Aryan races. Generally,
in both China and Japan the Dragon is regarded with a veneration equal
to the horror with which the serpent is visited. Of this phenomenon and
its analogies in Britain I shall have an explanation to submit when we
come to consider Dragon-myths more particularly. To this general rule
the &lsquo;Bob-tailed Dragon&rsquo; of China is a partial exception.
His fidelity as a friend led to the ill return of an attack by which
his tail was amputated, and ever since his soured temper has shown
itself in raising storms. When a violent tempest arises the Cantonese
say, &lsquo;The Bob-tailed Dragon is passing,&rsquo; in the same
proverbial way as the Aryan peasantries attribute the same phenomenon
to their storm-gods.</p>
<p>The notion is widely prevalent in some districts of France that all
whirlwinds, however slight, are caused by wizards or witches, who are
in them, careering through the air; and it is stated by the
<i>Melusine</i> that in the department of the Orne storms are
attributed to the clergy, who are supposed to be circling in them. The
same excellent journal states that some years ago, in that department,
a parishioner who saw his crops threatened by a hail-storm fired into
the cloud. The next day he heard that the parish priest had broken his
leg by a fall for which he could not account.</p>
<p>The following examples are given by Kuhn. Near Stangenhagen is a
treasure hid in a mountain which Lord <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>von Th&uuml;men tried
to seek, but was caught up with his horse by a whirlwind and deposited
at home again. The Devil is believed to be seated at the centre of
every whirlwind. At Biesenthal it is said a noble lady became the
Wind&rsquo;s bride. She was in her time a famous rider and huntress,
who rode recklessly over farmers&rsquo; fields and gardens; now she is
herself hunted by snakes and dragons, and may be heard howling in every
storm.</p>
<p>I suspect that the bristling hair so frequently portrayed in the
Japanese Oni, Devils, refers to their frequent residence at the centre
of a gale of wind. Their demon of the storm is generally pictured
throned upon a flower of flames, his upraised and extended fingers
emitting the most terrific lightnings, which fall upon his victims and
envelop them in flames. Sometimes, however, the Japanese artists poke
fun at their thunder-god, and show him sprawling on the ground from the
recoil of his own lightnings. The following extract from <i>The
Christian Herald</i> (London, April 12, 1877) will show how far the
dread of this Japanese Oni extends: &lsquo;A pious father writes,
&lsquo;A few days ago there was a severe thunderstorm, which seemed to
gather very heavily in the direction where my son lived; and I had a
feeling that I must go and pray that he might be protected, and not be
killed by the lightning. The impression seemed to say, &lsquo;There is
no time to be lost.&rsquo; I obeyed, and went and knelt down and prayed
that the Lord would spare his life. I believe he heard my prayer. My
son called on me afterwards, and, speaking of the shower, said,
&lsquo;The lightning came downwards and struck the very hoe in my
hands, and numbed me.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Perhaps you would have been
killed if some one had not been praying for you.&rsquo; Since then he
has been converted, and, I trust, will be saved in God&rsquo;s
everlasting kingdom.&rsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd26e2412" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>Such paragraphs may now strike even many christians <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>as
&lsquo;survivals.&rsquo; But it is not so very long since some eminent
clergymen looked upon Benjamin Franklin as the heaven-defying Ajax of
Christendom, because he undertook to show people how they might divert
the lightnings from their habitations. In those days Franklin
personally visited a church at Streatham, whose steeple had been struck
by lightning, and, after observing the region, gave an opinion that if
the steeple were again erected without a lightning-rod, it would again
be struck. The audacious man who &lsquo;snatched sceptres from tyrants
and lightnings from heaven,&rsquo; as the proverb ran, was not listened
to: the steeple was rebuilt, and again demolished by lightning.</p>
<p>The supreme god of the Quichuas (American), <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2421" title="Source: Viracvcha">Viracocha</span> (&lsquo;sea
foam&rsquo;), rises out of Lake Titicaca, and journeys with lightnings
for all opposers, to disappear in the Western Ocean. The Quichua is
mentally brother of the Arab camel-driver. &lsquo;The sea,&rsquo; it is
said in the &lsquo;Arabian Nights,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;the sea became
troubled before them, and there arose from it a black pillar, ascending
towards the sky, and approaching the meadow,&rsquo; and &lsquo;behold
it was a Jinn<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2424src" href="#xd26e2424"
name="xd26e2424src">23</a> of gigantic stature.&rsquo; The Jinn is
sometimes helpful as it is formidable; it repays the fisherman who
unseals it from the casket fished up from the sea, as fruitfulness
comes out of the cloud no larger than a man&rsquo;s hand evoked by
Elijah. The perilous Jinn described in the above extract is the
waterspout. Waterspouts are attributed in China to the battles of
dragons in the air, and the same country recognises a demon of high
tides. The newest goddess in China is a canonised protectress against
the shipwrecking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"

recently proclaimed by the Government of the empire in obedience, as
the edict stated, to the belief prevailing among sailors. In this the
Chinese are a long way behind the mariners and fishermen of the French
coast, who have for centuries, by a pious philology, connected
&lsquo;Maria&rsquo; with &lsquo;La Mar&eacute;e&rsquo; and &lsquo;La
Mer;&rsquo; and whenever they have been saved from storms, bring their
votive offerings to sea-side shrines of the Star of the Sea.</p>
<p>The old Jewish theology, in its eagerness to claim for Jehovah the
absolutism which would make him &lsquo;Lord of lords,&rsquo; instituted
his responsibility for many doubtful performances, the burthen of which
is now escaped by the device of saying that he &lsquo;permitted&rsquo;
them. In this way the Elohim who brought on the Deluge have been
identified with Jehovah. None the less must we see in the biblical
account of the Flood the action of tempestuous water-demons. What power
a christian would recognise in such an event were it related in the
sacred books of another religion may be seen in the vision of the
Apocalypse&mdash;&lsquo;The Serpent cast out of his mouth a flood of
water after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away with
the flood; and the earth helped the woman and opened its mouth and
swallowed up the flood.&rsquo; This Demon of Inundation meets the
explorer of Egyptian and Accadian inscriptions at every turn. The
terrible Seven, whom even the God of Fire cannot control, &lsquo;break
down the banks of the Abyss of Waters.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

association of eclipse and flood: &lsquo;On the fifteenth day an
eclipse takes place. The king dies; and rains in the heaven, floods in
the channels are.&rsquo; &lsquo;In the month of Elul (August), the
fourteenth day, an eclipse takes place&#8202;&hellip;. Northward

<p>In the Chald&aelig;o-Babylonian cosmogony the three zones of the
universe were ruled over by a Triad as follows: the Heaven by Anu; the
surface of the earth, including the atmosphere, by Bel; the under-world
by Nouah.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2452src" href="#xd26e2452" name=
"xd26e2452src">28</a> This same Nouah is the Assyrian Hea or Saviour;
and it is Noah of the Bible. The name means a rest or
residence,&mdash;the place where man may dwell. When Tiamat the Dragon,
or the Leviathan, opens &lsquo;the fountains of the great deep,&rsquo;
and Anu &lsquo;the windows of Heaven,&rsquo; it is Hea or Noah who
saves the life of man. M. Fran&ccedil;ois Lenormant has shown this to
be the probable sense of one of the most ancient Accadian fragments in
the British Museum. In it allusion is made to &lsquo;the serpent of

<p>The Hydra may be taken as a type of the destructive water-demon in a
double sense, for its heads remain in many mythical forms. The Syrian
Dagon and Atergatis, fish-deities, have bequeathed but their element to
our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>Undines of romance. Some nymphs have so long
been detached from aqueous associations as to have made their names
puzzling, and their place in demonology more so. To the Nixy
(<span class="trans" title="n&#275;ch&#333;"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&nu;&#8053;&chi;&omega;</span></span>) of Germany, now merely
mischievous like the British Pixy, many philologists trace the common
phrase for the Devil,&mdash;&lsquo;Old Nick.&rsquo; I believe, however,
that this phrase owes its popularity to St. Nicholas rather than to the
Norse water-god whose place he was assigned after the christian
accession. This saintly Poseidon, who, from being the patron of
fishermen, gradually became associated with that demon whom, Sir Walter
Scott said, &lsquo;the British sailor feared when he feared nothing
else,&rsquo; was also of old the patron of pirates; and robbers were
called &lsquo;St. Nicholas&rsquo; clerks.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2549src" href="#xd26e2549" name="xd26e2549src">33</a> In Norway
and the Netherlands the ancient belief in the demon Nikke was strong;
he was a kind of Wild Huntsman of the Sea, and has left many legends,
of which &lsquo;The Flying Dutchman&rsquo; is one. But my belief is
that, through his legendary relation to boys, St. Nicholas gave the
name Old Nick its modern moral accent. Because of his reputation for
having restored to life three murdered children St. Nicholas was made
their patron, and on his day, December 6, it was the old custom to
consecrate a Boy-Bishop, who held office until the 28th of the month.
By this means he became the moral appendage of the old Wodan god of the
Germanic races, who was believed in winter time to find shelter in and
shower benefits from evergreens, especially firs, on his favourite
children who happened to wander beneath them. &lsquo;Bartel,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Klaubauf,&rsquo; or whatever he might be called, was reduced to
be the servant of St. Nicholas, whose name is now jumbled into
&lsquo;Santaclaus.&rsquo; According to the old custom he appeared
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>attended by his Knecht Klaubauf&mdash;personated
by those who knew all about the children&mdash;bringing a sort of
doomsday. The gifts having been bestowed on the good children, St.
Nicholas then ordered Klaubauf to put the naughty ones into his pannier
and carry them off for punishment. The terror and shrieks thus caused
have created vast misery among children, and in Munich and some other
places the authorities have very properly made such tragedies illegal.
But for many centuries it was the custom of nurses and mothers to
threaten refractory children with being carried off at the end of the
year by Nicholas; and in this way each year closed, in the young
apprehension, with a Judgment Day, a Weighing of Souls, and a Devil or
Old Nick as agent of retribution.</p>
<p>Nick has long since lost his aquatic character, and we find his name
in the Far West (America) turning up as &lsquo;The Nick of the
Woods,&rsquo;&mdash;the wild legend of a settler who, following a vow
of vengeance for his wrongs, used to kill the red men while they slept,
and was supposed to be a demon. The Japanese have a
water-dragon&mdash;Kappa&mdash;of a retributive and moral kind, whose
office it is to swallow bad boys who go to swim in disobedience to
their parents&rsquo; commands, or at improper times and places. It is
not improbable that such dangers to the young originated some of the
water-demons,&mdash;probably such as are thought of as diminutive and
mischievous,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Nixies. The Nixa was for a long time on
the Baltic coast the female &lsquo;Old Nick,&rsquo; and much feared by
fishermen. Her malign disposition is represented in the Kelpie of
Scotland,&mdash;a water-horse, believed to carry away the unwary by
sudden floods to devour them. In Germany there was a river-goddess
whose temple stood at Magdeburg, whence its name. A legend exists of
her having appeared in the market there in christian costume, but she
was detected by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113"
name="pb113">113</a>]</span>a continual dripping of water from the
corner of her apron. In Germany the Nixies generally played the part of
the naiads of ancient times.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2564src" href=
"#xd26e2564" name="xd26e2564src">34</a> In Russia similar beings,
called Rusalkas, are much more formidable.</p>
<p>In many regions of Christendom it is related that these demons,
relatives of the Swan-maidens, considered in another chapter, have been
converted into friendly or even pious creatures, and baptized into
saintly names. Sometimes there are legends which reveal this
transition. Thus it is related that in the year 1440, the dikes of
Holland being broken down by a violent tempest, the sea overflowed the
meadows; and some maidens of the town of Edam, in West Friesland, going
in a boat to milk their cows, espied a mermaid embarrassed in the mud,
the waters being very shallow. They took it into their boat and brought
it to Edam, and dressed it in women&rsquo;s apparel, and taught it to
spin. It ate as they did, but could not be brought to speak. It was
carried to Haarlem, where it lived for some years, though showing an
inclination to water. Parival, who tells the story, relates that they
had conveyed to it some notions of the existence of a deity, and it
made its reverences devoutly whenever it passed a crucifix.</p>
<p>Another creature of the same species was in the year 1531 caught in
the Baltic, and sent as a present to Sigismund, King of Poland. It was
seen by all the persons about the court, but only lived three days.</p>

<p>The Hydra&mdash;the torrent which, cut off in one direction, makes

<p>The once perilous Strudel and Wirbel of the Danube are haunted by
diabolical legends. From Dr. William Beattie&rsquo;s admirable work on
&lsquo;The Danube&rsquo; I quote the following
passages:&mdash;&lsquo;After descending the Greinerschwall, or rapids
of Grein above mentioned, the river rolls on for a considerable space,
in a deep and almost tranquil volume, which, by contrast with the
approaching turmoil, gives increased effect to its wild, stormy, and
romantic features. At first a hollow, subdued roar, like that of
distant thunder, strikes the ear and rouses the traveller&rsquo;s
attention. This increases every second, and the stir and activity which
now prevail among the hands on board show that additional force,
vigilance, and caution are to be employed in the use of the helm and
oars. The water is now changed in its colour&mdash;chafed into foam,
and agitated like a seething cauldron. In front, and in the centre of
the channel, rises an abrupt, isolated, and colossal rock, fringed with
wood, and crested with a mouldering tower, on the summit of which is
planted a lofty cross, to which in the moment of danger the ancient
boatmen were wont to address their prayers for deliverance. The first
sight of this used to create no little excitement and apprehension on
board; the master ordered strict silence to be observed, the steersman
grasped the helm with a firmer hand, the passengers moved aside, so as
to leave free space for the boatmen, while the women and children were
hurried into the cabin, there to await, with feelings of no little
anxiety, the result of the enterprise. Every boatman, with his head
uncovered, muttered a prayer to his patron saint; and away dashed the
barge through the tumbling breakers, that seemed as if hurrying it on
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>inevitable destruction. All these preparations,
joined by the wildness of the adjacent scenery, the terrific aspect of
the rocks, and the tempestuous state of the water, were sufficient to
produce a powerful sensation on the minds even of those who had been
all their lives familiar with dangers; while the shadowy phantoms with
which superstition had peopled it threw a deeper gloom over the whole
scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the whirlpool called Wirbel, and the surrounding ruins,
the same author writes: &lsquo;Each of these mouldering fortresses was
the subject of some miraculous tradition, which circulated at every
hearth. The sombre and mysterious aspect of the place, its wild
scenery, and the frequent accidents which occurred in the passage,
invested it with awe and terror; but above all, the superstitions of
the time, a belief in the marvellous, and the credulity of the boatmen,
made the navigation of the Strudel and the Wirbel a theme of the
wildest romance. At night, sounds that were heard far above the roar of
the Danube issued from every ruin. Magical lights flashed through their
loopholes and casements, festivals were held in the long-deserted
halls, maskers glided from room to room, the waltzers maddened to the
strains of an infernal orchestra, armed sentinels paraded the
battlements, while at intervals the clash of arms, the neighing of
steeds, and the shrieks of unearthly combatants smote fitfully on the
boatmen&rsquo;s ear. But the tower on which these scenes were most
fearfully enacted was that on the Longstone, commonly called the
&lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Tower,&rsquo; as it well deserved to be&mdash;for
here, in close communion with his master, resided the &lsquo;Black
Monk,&rsquo; whose office it was to exhibit false lights and landmarks
along the gulf, so as to decoy the vessels into the whirlpool, or dash
them against the rocks. He was considerably annoyed in his quarters,
however, on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>the arrival of the great Soliman in these
regions; for to repel the turbaned host, or at least to check their
triumphant progress to the Upper Danube, the inhabitants were summoned
to join the national standard, and each to defend his own hearth.
Fortifications were suddenly thrown up, even churches and other
religious edifices were placed in a state of military defence; women
and children, the aged and the sick, as already mentioned in our notice
of Schaumburg, were lodged in fortresses, and thus secured from the
violence of the approaching Moslem. Among the other points at which the
greatest efforts were made to check the enemy, the passage of the
Strudel and Wirbel was rendered as impregnable as the time and
circumstances of the case would allow. To supply materials for the
work, patriotism for a time got the better of superstition, and the
said Devil&rsquo;s Tower was demolished and converted into a strong
breastwork. Thus forcibly dislodged, the Black Monk is said to have
pronounced a malediction on the intruders, and to have chosen a new
haunt among the recesses of the Harz mountains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the glaciers send down their torrents and flood the Rhone, it
is the immemorial belief that the Devil may be sometimes seen swimming
in it, with a sword in one hand and a golden globe in the other. Since
it is contrary to all orthodox folklore that the Devil should be so
friendly with water, the name must be regarded as a modern substitute
for the earlier Rhone demon. We probably get closer to the original
form of the superstition in the Swiss Oberland, which interprets the
noises of the Furka Glacier, which feeds the Rhone, as the groans of
wicked souls condemned for ever to labour there in directing the
river&rsquo;s course; their mistress being a demoness who sometimes
appears just before the floods, floating on a raft, and ordering the
river to rise. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is a tidal demonolatry also. The author of &lsquo;Rambles in
Northumberland&rsquo; gives a tradition concerning the river Wansbeck:
&lsquo;This river discharges itself into the sea at a place called
Cambois, about nine miles to the eastward, and the tide flows to within
five miles of Morpeth. Tradition reports that Michael Scott, whose fame
as a wizard is not confined to Scotland, would have brought the tide to
the town had not the courage of the person failed upon whom the
execution of this project depended. This agent of Michael, after his
principal had performed certain spells, was to run from the
neighbourhood of Cambois to Morpeth without looking behind, and the
tide would follow him. After having advanced a certain distance he
became alarmed at the roaring of the waters behind him, and forgetting
the injunction, gave a glance over his shoulder to see if the danger
was imminent, when the advancing tide immediately stopped, and the
burgesses of Morpeth thus lost the chance of having the Wansbeck
navigable between their town and the sea. It is also said that Michael
intended to confer a similar favour on the inhabitants of Durham, by
making the Wear navigable to their city; but his good intentions, which
were to be carried into effect in the same manner, were also frustrated
by the cowardice of the person who had to guide the tide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gentle and just king &AElig;olus, who taught his islanders
navigation, in his mythologic transfiguration had to share the wayward
dispositions of the winds he was said to rule; but though he wrecked
the Trojan fleet and many a ship, his old human heart remained to be
trusted on the appearance of Halcyon. His unhappy daughter of that name
cast herself into the sea after the shipwreck of her husband
(Ce&#775;yx), and the two were changed into birds. It was believed that
for seven days before and seven after <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>the shortest day of
the year, when the halcyon is breeding, &AElig;olus restrains his
winds, and the sea is calm. The accent of this fable has been
transmitted to some variants of the folklore of swans. In Russia the
Tsar Morskoi or Water Demon&rsquo;s beautiful daughters (swans) may
naturally be supposed to influence the tides which the fair bathers of
our time are reduced to obey. In various regions the tides are believed
to have some relation to swans, and to respect them. I have met with a
notion of this kind in England. On the day of Livingstone&rsquo;s
funeral there was an extraordinary tide in the Thames, which had been
predicted and provided for. The crowds which had gathered at the Abbey
on that occasion repaired after the funeral to Westminster Bridge to
observe the tide, and among them was a venerable disbeliever in
science, who announced to a group that there would be no high tide,
&lsquo;because the swans were nesting.&rsquo; This sceptic was speedily
put to confusion by the result, and perhaps one superstition the less
remained in the circle that seemed to regard him as an oracle.</p>
<p>The Russian peasantry live in much fear of the Rusalkas and
Vodyanuie, water-spirits who, of course, have for their chief the surly
Neptune Tsar Morskoi. In deprecation of this tribe, the peasant is
careful not to bathe without a cross round the neck, nor to ford a
stream on horseback without signing a cross on the water with a scythe
or knife. In the Ukrain these water-demons are supposed to be the
transformed souls of Pharaoh and his host when they were drowned, and
they are increased by people who drown themselves. In Bohemia fishermen
are known sometimes to refuse aid to one drowning, for fear the Vodyany
will be offended and prevent the fish, over which he holds rule, from
entering their nets. The wrath of such beings is indicated by the
upheavals of water and foam; and they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>are supposed
especially mischievous in the spring, when torrents and floods are
pouring from melted snow. Those undefined monsters which Beowulf slew,
Grendel and his mother, are interpreted by Simrock as personifications
of the untamed sea and stormy floods invading the low flat shores,
whose devastations so filled Faust with horror (II. iv.), and in
combating which his own hitherto desolating powers found their
task.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The Sea sweeps on in thousand quarters flowing,</p>

</div>
<p class="first">In such brave work Faust had many forerunners, whose
art and courage have their monument in the fairer fables of all these
elemental powers in which fear saw demons. Pavana, in India, messenger
of the gods, rides upon the winds, and in his forty-nine forms,
corresponding with the points of the Hindu compass, guards the earth.
Solomon, too, journeyed on a magic carpet woven of the winds, which
still serves the purposes of the Wise. From the churned ocean rose
Lakshm&iacute; (after the solar origin was lost to the myth), Hindu
goddess of prosperity; and from the sea-foam rose Aphrodite, Beauty.
These fair forms had their true worshipper in the Northman, who left on
mastered wind and wave his song as Emerson found it&mdash;</p>

&lsquo;Folklore of China,&rsquo; p. 124. The drum held by the imp in
<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a> shows his relation to the thunder-god. In
Japan the thunder-god is represented as having five drums strung
together. The wind-god has a large bag of compressed air between his
shoulders; and he has steel claws, representing the keen and piercing
wind. The Tartars in Siberia believe that a potent demon may be evoked
by beating a drum; their sorcerers provide a tame bear, who starts upon
the scene, and from whom they pretend to get answers to questions. In
Nova Scotian superstition we find demons charmed by drums into
quietude. In India the temple-drum preserved such solemn associations
even for the new theistic sect, the Brahmo-Somaj, that it is said to be
still beaten as accompaniment to the organ sent to their chief church
by their English friends.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Although the Koran and other authorities, as already stated, have
associated the Jinn with etherial fire, Arabic folklore is nearer the
meaning of the word in assigning the name to all demons. The learned

<p class="first">The animal demons&mdash;those whose evil repute is the
result of something in their nature which may be inimical to
man&mdash;should be distinguished from the forms which have been
diabolised by association with mythological personages or ideas. The
lion, tiger, and wolf are examples of the one class; the stag, horse,
owl, and raven of the other. But there are circumstances which render
it very difficult to observe this distinction. The line has to be
drawn, if at all, between the measureless forces of degradation on the
one side, discovering some evil in animals which, but for their bad
associations, would not have been much thought of; and of euphemism on
the other, transforming harmful beasts to benignant agents by dwelling
upon some minor characteristic.</p>
<p>There are a few obviously dangerous animals, such as the serpent,
where it is easy to pick our way; we can recognise the fear that
flatters it to an agathodemon and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122"
href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>the diminished fear that
pronounces it accurst.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2656src" href=
"#xd26e2656" name="xd26e2656src">1</a> But what shall be said of the
Goat? Was there really anything in its smell or in its flesh when first
eaten, its butting, or injury to plants, which originally classed it
among the unclean animals? or was it merely demonised because of its
uncanny and shaggy appearance? What explanation can be given of the
evil repute of our household friend the Cat? Is it derived by
inheritance from its fierce ancestors of the jungle? Was it first
suggested by its horrible human-like sleep-murdering caterwaulings at
night? or has it simply suffered from a theological curse on the cats
said to draw the chariots of the goddesses of Beauty? The demonic Dog
is, if anything, a still more complex subject. The student of mythology
and folklore speedily becomes familiar with the trivial sources from
which vast streams of superstition often issue. The cock&rsquo;s
challenge to the all-detecting sun no doubt originated his ominous
career from the Code of Manu to the cock-headed devils frescoed in the
cathedrals of Russia. The fleshy, forked roots of a soporific plant
issued in that vast Mandrake Mythology which has been the subject of
many volumes, without being even yet fully explored. The Italians have
a saying that &lsquo;One knavery of the hedgehog is worth more than
many of the fox;&rsquo; yet the nocturnal and hibernating habits and
general quaintness of the humble hedgehog, rather than his furtive
propensity to prey on eggs and chickens, must have raised him to the
honours of demonhood. In various popular fables this little animal
proves more than a match for the wolf and the serpent. It was in the
form of a hedgehog that the Devil is said to have made the attempt to
let in the sea through the Brighton Downs, which was prevented by a
light being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>brought, though the seriousness of the scheme is
still attested in the Devil&rsquo;s Dyke. There is an ancient tradition
that when the Devil had smuggled himself into Noah&rsquo;s Ark, he
tried to sink it by boring a hole; but this scheme was defeated, and
the human race saved, by the hedgehog stuffing himself into the hole.
In the Brighton story the Devil would appear to have remembered his
former failure in drowning people, and to have appropriated the form
which defeated him.</p>

<p>The Fox, as incarnation of cunning, holds in the primitive belief of
the Japanese almost the same position as the Serpent in the nations
that have worshipped, until bold enough to curse it. In many of the
early pictures of Japanese demons one may generally detect amid their
human, wolfish, or other characters some traits of the <i>kitsune</i>
(fox). He is always the soul of the three-eyed demon of Japan (<a href=
"#fig7">fig. 7</a>). He is the sagacious &lsquo;Vizier,&rsquo; as the
Persian Desatir calls him, and is practically the Japanese scape-goat.
If a fox has appeared in any neighbourhood, the next trouble is
attributed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>to his visit; and on such occasions the
sufferers and their friends repair to some ancient gnarled tree in
which the fox is theoretically resident and propitiate him, just as
would be done to a serpent in other regions. In Japan the fox is not
regarded as always harmful, but generally so. He is not to be killed on
any account. Being thus spared through superstition, the foxes increase
sufficiently to supply abundant material for the continuance of its
demonic character. &lsquo;Take us the foxes, the little foxes that
spoil the vines,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2678src" href=
"#xd26e2678" name="xd26e2678src">2</a> is an admonition reversed in
Japan. The correspondence between the cunning respected in this animal
and that of the serpent, reverenced elsewhere, is confirmed by Mr. Fitz
Cunliffe Owen, who observed, as he informs me, that the Japanese will
not kill even the poisonous snakes which crawl freely amid the decaying
Buddhist temples of Nikko, one of the most sacred places in Japan,
where once as many as eight thousand monastic Buddhists were harboured.
It is the red fox that abounds in Japan, and its human-like cry at
night near human habitations is such as might easily encourage these
superstitions. But, furthermore, mythology supplies many illustrations
of a creditable tendency among rude tribes to mark out for special
veneration or fear any force in nature finer than mere strength.
Emerson says, &lsquo;Foxes are so cunning because they are not
strong.&rsquo; In our Japanese demon, whose three eyes alone connect it
with the pr&aelig;ternatural vision ascribed by that race to the fox,
the harelip is very pronounced. That little animal, the Hare, is
associated with a large mythology, perhaps because out of its weakness
proceeds its main forces of survival&mdash;timidity, vigilance, and
swiftness. The superstition concerning the hare is found in Africa. The
same animal is the much-venerated good genius of the Calmucs, who call
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>him S&aacute;kya-muni (Buddha), and say that on
earth he submitted himself to be eaten by a starving man, for which
gracious deed he was raised to dominion over the moon, where they
profess to see him. The legend is probably traceable back to the
Sanskrit word <i>sasin</i>, moon, which means literally &lsquo;the
hare-marked.&rsquo; <i>Sasa</i> means &lsquo;hare.&rsquo; Pausanias
relates the story of the moon-goddess instructing exiles to build their
city where they shall see a hare take refuge in a
myrtle-grove.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2692src" href="#xd26e2692"
name="xd26e2692src">3</a> In the demonic fauna of Japan another cunning
animal figures&mdash;the Weasel. The name of this demon is &lsquo;the
sickle weasel,&rsquo; and it also seems to occupy the position of a
scape-goat. In the language of a Japanese report, &lsquo;When a
person&rsquo;s clogs slip from under his feet, and he falls and cuts
his face on the gravel, or when a person, who is out at night when he
ought to have been at home, presents himself to his family with a
freshly-scarred face, the wound is referred to the agency of the
malignant invisible weasel and his sharp sickle.&rsquo; In an
aboriginal legend of America, also, two sister demons commonly take the
form of weasels.</p>
<p>The popular feeling which underlay much of the animal-worship in
ancient times was probably that which is reflected in the Japanese
notions of to-day, as told in the subjoined sketch from an amusing
book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of these visitors was an old man, who himself was at the
time a victim of a popular superstition that the departed revisit the
scenes of their life in this world in shapes of different animals. We
noticed that he was not in his usual spirits, and pressed him to
unburden his mind to us. He said he had lost his little son Chiosin,
but that was not so much the cause of his grief as the absurd way in
which his wife, backed up by a whole conclave of old women who had
taken up their abode in his house to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>comfort her, was
going on. &lsquo;What do they all do?&rsquo; we asked sympathetically.
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;every beastly animal that comes
to my house, there is a cry amongst them all, &lsquo;Chiosin, Chiosin
has come back!&rsquo; and the whole house swarms with cats and dogs and
bats&mdash;for they say they are not quite sure which is Chiosin, and
that they had better be kind to the lot than run the chance of treating
him badly; the consequence is, all these brutes are fed on my rice and
meat, and now I am driven out of doors and called an unnatural parent
because I killed a mosquito which bit me!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2701src" href="#xd26e2701" name="xd26e2701src">4</a></p>
<p>The strange and inexplicable behaviour of animals in cases of fear,
panic, or pain has been generally attributed by ignorant races to their
possession by demons. Of this nature is the story of the devil entering
the herd of swine and carrying them into the sea, related in the New
Testament. It is said that even yet in some parts of Scotland the
milkmaid carries a switch of the magical rowan to expel the demon that
sometimes enters the cow. Professor Monier Williams writes from
Southern India&mdash;&lsquo;When my fellow-travellers and myself were
nearly dashed to pieces over a precipice the other day by some restive
horses on a ghat near Poona, we were told that the road at this
particular point was haunted by devils who often caused similar
accidents, and we were given to understand that we should have done
well to conciliate Ganesa, son of the god Siva, and all his troops of
evil spirits, before starting.&rsquo; The same writer also tells us
that the guardian spirits or &lsquo;mothers&rsquo; who haunt most
regions of the Peninsula are believed to ride about on horses, and if
they are angry, scatter blight and disease. Hence the traveller just
arrived from Europe is startled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>and puzzled by apparitions of
rudely-formed terra-cotta horses, often as large as life, placed by the
peasantry round shrines in the middle of fields as acceptable
propitiatory offerings, or in the fulfilment of vows in periods of
sickness.<a id="xd26e2708" name="xd26e2708"></a><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2709src" href="#xd26e2709" name="xd26e2709src">5</a></p>
<p>This was the belief of the Corinthians in the Taraxippos, or shade
of Glaucus, who, having been torn in pieces by the horses with which he
had been racing, and which he had fed on human flesh to make more
spirited, remained to haunt the Isthmus and frighten horses during the
races.</p>
<p>There is a modern legend in the Far West (America) of a horse called
&lsquo;The White Devil,&rsquo; which, in revenge for some harm to its
comrades, slew men by biting and trampling them, and was itself slain
after defying many attempts at its capture; but among the many ancient
legends of demon-horses there are few which suggest anything about that
animal hostile to man. His occasional evil character is simply derived
from his association with man, and is therefore postponed. For a
similar reason the Goat also must be dealt with hereafter, and as a
symbolical animal. A few myths are met with which relate to its
unpleasant characteristics. In South Guinea the odour of goats is
accounted for by the Saga that their ancestor having had the
presumption to ask a goddess for her aromatic ointment, she angrily
rubbed him with ointment of a reverse kind. It has also been said that
it was regarded as a demon by the worshippers of Bacchus, because it
cropped the vines; and that it thus originated the Trageluphoi, or
goat-stag monsters mentioned by Plato,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2717src" href="#xd26e2717" name="xd26e2717src">6</a> and gave us

"#xd26e2723" name="xd26e2723src">7</a> But such traits of the Goat can
have very little to do with its important relations to Mythology
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>and Demonology. To the list of animals demonised
by association must also be added the Stag. No doubt the anxious
mothers, wives, or sweethearts of rash young huntsmen utilised the old
fables of beautiful hinds which in the deep forests changed to demons
and devoured their pursuers,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2728src" href=
"#xd26e2728" name="xd26e2728src">8</a> for admonition; but the fact
that such stags had to transform themselves for evil work is a
sufficient certificate of character to prevent their being included
among the animal demons proper, that is, such as have in whole or part
supplied in their disposition to harm man the basis of a demonic
representation.</p>
<p>It will not be deemed wonderful that Rats bear a venerable rank in
Demonology. The shudder which some nervous persons feel at sight of
even a harmless mouse is a survival from the time when it was believed
that in this form unshriven souls or unbaptized children haunted their
former homes; and probably it would be difficult to estimate the number
of ghost-stories which have originated in their nocturnal scamperings.
Many legends report the departure of unhallowed souls from human mouths
in the shape of a Mouse. During the earlier Napoleonic wars mice were
used in Southern Germany as diviners, by being set with inked feet on
the map of Europe to show where the fatal Frenchmen would march. They
gained this sanctity by a series of associations with force stretching
back to the Hindu fable of a mouse delivering the elephant and the lion
by gnawing the cords that bound them. The battle of the Frogs and Mice
is ascribed to Homer. Mice are said to have foretold the first civil
war in Rome by gnawing the gold in the temple. Rats appear in various
legends as avengers. The uncles of King Popelus II., murdered by him
and his wife and thrown into a lake, reappear as rats and gnaw the king
and queen to death. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span>The same fate overtakes Miskilaus of
Poland, through the transformed widows and orphans he had wronged.
Mouse Tower, standing in the middle of the Rhine, is the haunted
monument of cruel Archbishop Hatto, of Mainz, who (anno 970) bade the
famine-stricken people repair to his barn, wherein he shut them fast
and burned them. But next morning an army of rats, having eaten all the
corn in his granaries, darkened the roads to the palace. The prelate
sought refuge from them in the Tower, but they swam after, gnawed
through the walls and devoured him.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2737src"

<p>St. Gertrude, wearing the funereal mantle of Holda, commands an army
of mice. In this respect she succeeds to the Pied Piper of Hamelin, who
also leads off children; and my ingenious friend Mr. John Fiske
suggests that this may be the reason why Irish servant-maids often show
such frantic terror at sight of a mouse.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2742src" href="#xd26e2742" name="xd26e2742src">10</a> The care of
children is often intrusted to them, and the appearance of mice
prognosticated of old the appearance of the pr&aelig;ternatural
rat-catcher and psychopomp. Pliny says that in his time it was
considered fortunate to meet a white rat. The people of Bassorah always
bow to these revered animals when seen, no doubt to propitiate
them.</p>
<p>The Lion is a symbol of majesty and of the sun in his glory (reached
in the zodiacal Leo), though here and there his original demonic
character appears,&mdash;as in the combats of Indra, Samson, and
Herakles with terrible lions. Euphemism, in one sense, fulfils the
conditions of Samson&rsquo;s riddle&mdash;Sweetness coming out of the
Strong&mdash;and has brought honey out of the Lion. His cruel character
has subtly fallen to Sirius the Dog-star, to whom are ascribed the
drought and malaria of &lsquo;dog-days&rsquo; (when the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>sun
is in Leo); but the primitive fact is intimated in several fables like
that of Arist&aelig;us, who, born after his mother had been rescued
from the Lybian lion, was worshipped in Ceos as a saviour from both
droughts and lions. The Lion couching at the feet of beautiful Doorga
in India, reappears drawing the chariot of Aphrodite, and typifies the
potency of beauty rather than, as Emerson interprets, that beauty
depends on strength. The chariot of the Norse Venus, Freyja, was drawn
by Cats, diminished forms of her Southern sister&rsquo;s steeds. It was
partly by these routes the Cat came to play the sometimes beneficent
r&ocirc;le in Russian, and to some extent in German, French, and
English folklore,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Puss in Boots, Whittington and his
Cat, and Madame D&rsquo;Aulnoy&rsquo;s <i>La Chatte Blanche</i>. The
demonic characteristics of the destructive cats have been inherited by
the black,&mdash;or, as in Macbeth, the brindled,&mdash;cat. In Germany
the approach of a cat to a sick-bed announces death; to dream of one is
an evil omen. In Hungary it is said every black cat becomes a witch at
the age of seven. It is the witch&rsquo;s favourite riding-horse, but
may sometimes be saved from such servitude by incision of the sign of
the cross. A scratch from a black cat is thought to be the beginning of
a fatal spell.</p>
<p>De Gubernatis<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2757src" href="#xd26e2757"
name="xd26e2757src">11</a> has a very curious speculation concerning
the origin of our familiar fable the Kilkenny Cats, which he traces to
the German superstition which dreads the combat between cats as
presaging death to one who witnesses it; and this belief he finds
reflected in the Tuscan child&rsquo;s &lsquo;game of souls,&rsquo; in
which the devil and angel are supposed to contend for the soul. The
author thinks this may be one outcome of the contest between Night and
Twilight in Mythology; but, if the connection can be traced, it would
probably prove to be derived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>from the struggle between the two
angels of Death, one variation of which is associated with the legend
of the strife for the body of Moses. The Book of Enoch says that
Gabriel was sent, before the Flood, to excite the man-devouring giants
to destroy one another. In an ancient Persian picture in my possession,
animal monsters are shown devouring each other, while their proffered
victim, like Daniel, is unharmed. The idea is a natural one, and hardly
requires comparative tracing.</p>
<p>Dr. Dennys tells us that in China there exists precisely the same
superstition as in Scotland as to the evil omen of a cat (or dog)
passing over a corpse. Brand and Pennant both mention this, the latter
stating that the cat or dog that has so done is killed without mercy.
This fact would seem to show that the fear is for the living, lest the
soul of the deceased should enter the animal and become one of the
innumerable werewolf or vampyre class of demons. But the origin of the
superstition is no doubt told in the Slavonic belief that if a cat leap
over a corpse the deceased person will become a vampyre.</p>
<p>In Russia the cat enjoys a somewhat better reputation than it does
in most other countries. Several peasants in the neighbourhood of
Moscow assured me that while they would never be willing to remain in a
church where a dog had entered, they would esteem it a good sign if a
cat came to church. One aged woman near Moscow told me that when the
Devil once tried to creep into Paradise he took the form of a mouse:
the Dog and Cat were on guard at the gates, and the Dog allowed the
evil one to pass, but the Cat pounced on him, and so defeated another
treacherous attempt against human felicity.</p>
<p>The Cat superstition has always been strong in Great Britain. It is,
indeed, in one sense true, as old Howell wrote (1647)&mdash;&lsquo;We
need not cross the sea for examples <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>of this kind, we have
too many (God wot) at home: King James a great while was loath to
believe there were witches; but that which happened to my Lord Francis
of Rutland&rsquo;s children convinced him, who were bewitched by an old
woman that was a servant of Belvoir Castle, but, being displeased, she
contracted with the Devil, who conversed with her in the form of a Cat,
whom she called Rutterkin, to make away those children out of mere
malignity and thirst of revenge.&rsquo; It is to be feared that many a
poor woman has been burned as a witch against whom her cherished cat
was the chief witness. It would be a curious psychological study to
trace how far the superstition owns a survival in even scientific
minds,&mdash;as in Buffon&rsquo;s vituperation of the cat, and in the
astonishing story, told by Mr. Wood, of a cat which saw a ghost (anno
1877)!</p>
<p>The Dog, so long the faithful friend of man, and even, possibly,
because of the degree to which he has caught his master&rsquo;s
manners, has a large demonic history. In the Semitic stories there are
many that indicate the path by which &lsquo;dog&rsquo; became the
Mussulman synonym of infidel; and the one dog Katmir who in Arabic
legend was admitted to Paradise for his faithful watching three hundred
and nine years before the cave of the Seven Sleepers,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2772src" href="#xd26e2772" name="xd26e2772src">12</a> must
have drifted among the Moslems from India as the Ephesian Sleepers did
from the christian world. In the beautiful episode of the
&lsquo;Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata,&rsquo; Yudhisthira having journeyed
to the door of heaven, refuses to enter into that happy abode unless
his faithful dog is admitted also. He is told by Indra, &lsquo;My
heaven hath no place for dogs; they steal away our offerings on
earth;&rsquo; and again, &lsquo;If a dog but behold a sacrifice, men
esteem it unholy and void.&rsquo; This difficulty was solved
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>by the Dog&mdash;Yama in
disguise&mdash;revealing himself and praising his friend&rsquo;s
fidelity. It is tolerably clear that it is to his connection with Yama,
god of Death, and under the evolution of that dualism which divided the
universe into upper and nether, that the Dog was degraded among our
Aryan ancestors; at the same time his sometimes wolfish disposition and
some other natural characters supplied the basis of his demonic
character. He was at once a dangerous and a corruptible guard.</p>

</div>
<p>In the early Vedic Mythology it is the abode of the gods that is
guarded by the two dogs, identified by solar mythologists as the
morning and evening twilight: a later phase shows them in the service
of Yama, and they reappear in the guardian of the Greek Hades,
Cerberus, and Orthros. The first of these has been traced to the Vedic
Sarvara, the latter to the monster Vritra. &lsquo;Orthros&rsquo; is the
phonetical equivalent of Vritra. The bitch Sarama, mother of the two
Vedic dogs, proved a treacherous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134"
href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>guard, and was slain by
Indra. Hence the Russian peasant comes fairly by another version of how
the Dog, while on guard, admitted the Devil into heaven on being thrown
a bone. But the two watch-dogs of the Hindu myth do not seem to bear an
evil character. In a funeral hymn of the &lsquo;Rig-Veda&rsquo; (x.
14), addressed to Yama, King of Death, we read:&mdash;&lsquo;By an
auspicious path do thou hasten past the two four-eyed brindled dogs,
the offspring of Sarama; then approach the beautiful Pitris who rejoice
together with Yama. Intrust him, O Yama, to thy two watch-dogs,
four-eyed, road-guarding, and man-observing. The two brown messengers
of Yama, broad of nostril and insatiable, wander about among men; may
they give us again to-day the auspicious breath of life that we may see
the sun!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And now thousands of years after this was said we find the Dog still
regarded as the seer of ghosts, and watcher at the gates of death, of
whose opening his howl forewarns. The howling of a dog on the night of
December 9, 1871, at Sandringham, where the Prince of Wales lay ill,
was thought important enough for newspapers to report to a shuddering
country. I read lately of a dog in a German village which was supposed
to have announced so many deaths that he became an object of general
terror, and was put to death. In that country belief in the demonic
character of the dog seems to have been strong enough to transmit an
influence even to the powerful brain of Goethe.</p>
<p>In Goethe&rsquo;s poem, it was when Faust was walking with the
student Wagner that the black Dog appeared, rushing around them in
spiral curves&mdash;spreading, as Faust said, &lsquo;a magic coil as a
snare around them;&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2794src" href=
"#xd26e2794" name="xd26e2794src">13</a> that after this dog
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>had followed Faust into his study, it assumed a
monstrous shape, until changed to a mist, from which Mephistopheles
steps forth&mdash;&lsquo;the kernel of the brute&rsquo;&mdash;in guise
of a travelling scholar. This is in notable coincidence with the
archaic symbolism of the Dog as the most frequent form of the
&lsquo;Lares&rsquo; (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>), or household genii,
originally because of its vigilance. The form here presented is nearly
identical with the Cynocephalus, whom the learned author of
&lsquo;Mankind: their Origin and Destiny,&rsquo; identifies as the
Adamic being set as a watch and instructor in Eden (Gen. xvi. 15), an
example of which, holding pen and tablet (as described by Horapollo),
is given in that work from Phil&aelig;. Chrysippus says that these were
afterwards represented as young men clothed with dog-skins. Remnants of
the tutelary character of the dog are scattered through German
folklore: he is regarded as oracle, ghost-seer, and gifted with second
sight; in Bohemia he is sometimes made to lick an infant&rsquo;s face
that it may see well.</p>

</div>
<p>The passage in &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; has been traced to Goethe&rsquo;s
antipathy to dogs, as expressed in his conversation with Falk at the
time of Wieland&rsquo;s death. &lsquo;Annihilation is utterly out of
the question; but the possibility of being caught on the way by some
more powerful and yet baser monas, and subordinated to it; this is
unquestionably a very serious consideration; and I, for my part, have
never been able entirely to divest myself of the fear of it, in the way
of a mere observation of nature.&rsquo; At this moment, says Falk, a
dog was heard repeatedly barking in the street. Goethe, sprang hastily
to the window and called to it: &lsquo;Take what <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>form
you will, vile larva, you shall not subjugate me!<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e2824" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> After some pause, he
resumed with the remark: &lsquo;This rabble of creation is extremely
offensive. It is a perfect pack of monades with which we are thrown
together in this planetary nook; their company will do us little honour
with the inhabitants of other planets, if they happen to hear anything
about them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In visiting the house where Goethe once resided in Weimar, I was
startled to find as the chief ornament of the hall a large bronze dog,
of full size, and very dark, looking proudly forth, as if he possessed
the Goethean monas after all. However, it is not probable that the
poet&rsquo;s real dislike of dogs arose solely from that speculation
about monades. It is more probable that in observing the old
wall-picture in Auerbach&rsquo;s cellar, wherein a dog stands beside
Mephistopheles, Goethe was led to consider carefully the causes of that
intimacy. Unfortunately, and notwithstanding the fables and the
sentiment which invest that animal, there are some very repulsive
things about him, such as his tendency to madness and the infliction on
man of a frightful death. The Greek Mania&rsquo;s &lsquo;fleet
hounds&rsquo; (Bacch&aelig; 977) have spread terrors far and wide.</p>
<p>Those who carefully peruse the account given by Mr. Lewes of the
quarrel between Karl August and Goethe, on account of the opposition of
the latter to the introduction of a performing dog on the Weimar
stage&mdash;an incident which led to his resignation of his position of
intendant of the theatre&mdash;may detect this aversion mingling with
his disgust as an artist; and it may be also suspected that it was not
the mere noise which caused the tortures he described himself as having
once endured at G&ouml;ttingen from the barking of dogs.</p>
<p>It is, however, not improbable that in the wild notion of Goethe,
joined with his cynophobia, we find a survival of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>the
belief of the Parsees of Surat, who venerate the Dog above all other
animals, and who, when one is dying, place a dog&rsquo;s muzzle near
his mouth, and make it bark twice, so that it may catch the departing
soul, and bear it to the waiting angel.</p>
<p>The devil-worshippers of Travancore to this day declare that the
evil power approaches them in the form of a Dog, as Mephistopheles
approached Faust. But before the superstition reached Goethe&rsquo;s
poem it had undergone many modifications; and especially its keen scent
had influenced the Norse imagination to ascribe to it
pr&aelig;ternatural wisdom. Thus we read in the Saga of Hakon the Good,
that when Eystein the Bad had conquered Drontheim, he offered the
people choice of his slave Thorer or his dog Sauer to be their king.
They chose the Dog. &lsquo;Now the dog was by witchcraft gifted with
three men&rsquo;s wisdom; and when he barked he spoke one word and
barked two.&rsquo; This Dog wore a collar of gold, and sat on a throne,
but, for all his wisdom and power, seems to have been a dog still; for
when some wolves invaded the cattle, he attacked and was torn to pieces
by them.</p>
<p>Among the negroes of the Southern States in America I have found the
belief that the most frequent form of a diabolical apparition is that
of a large Dog with fiery eyes, which may be among them an original
superstition attributable to their horror of the bloodhound, by which,
in some regions, they were pursued when attempting to escape. Among the
whites of the same region I have never been able to find any instance
of the same belief, though belief in the presage of the howling dog is
frequent; and it is possible that this is a survival from some region
in Africa, where the Dog has an evil name of the same kind as the
scape-goat. Among some tribes in Fazogl there is an annual carnival at
which every one does as he likes. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>king is then seated
in the open air, a dog tied to the leg of his chair, and the animal is
then stoned to death.</p>
<p>Mark Twain<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2843src" href="#xd26e2843"
name="xd26e2843src">14</a> records the folklore of a village of
Missouri, where we find lads quaking with fear at the howling of a
&lsquo;stray dog&rsquo; in the night, but indifferent to the howling of
a dog they recognise, which may be a form of the common English belief
that it is unlucky to be followed by a &lsquo;strange&rsquo; dog. From
the same book it appears also that the dog will always have his head in
the direction of the person whose doom is signified: the lads are
entirely relieved when they find the howling animal has his back turned
to them.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that these fragments of European superstition
should meet in the Far West a plentiful crop of their like which has
sprung up among the aborigines, as the following extract from Mr.
Brinton&rsquo;s work, &lsquo;Myths of the New World,&rsquo; will show:
&lsquo;Dogs were supposed to stand in some peculiar relation to the
moon, probably because they howl at it and run at night, uncanny
practices which have cost them dear in reputation. The custom prevailed
among tribes so widely asunder as Peruvians, Tupis, Creeks, Iroquois,
Algonquins, and Greenland Eskimos to thrash the curs most soundly
during an eclipse. The Creeks explained this by saying that the big Dog
was swallowing the sun, and that by whipping the little ones they could
make him desist. What the big Dog was they were not prepared to say. We
know. It was the night goddess, represented by the Dog, who was thus
shrouding the world at mid-day. In a better sense, they represented the
more agreeable characteristics of the lunar goddess. Xochiquetzal, most
fecund of Aztec divinities, patroness of love, of sexual pleasure, and
of child-birth, was likewise called <i>Itzcuinan</i>, which, literally
translated, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>is &lsquo;bitch-mother.&rsquo; This strange and
to us so repugnant title for a goddess was not without parallel
elsewhere. When in his wars the Inca Pachacutec carried his arms into
the province of Huanca, he found its inhabitants had installed in their
temples the figure of a Dog as their highest deity&#8202;&hellip;. This
canine canonisation explains why in some parts of Peru a priest was
called, by way of honour, <i>allco</i>, Dog!&hellip; Many tribes on the
Pacific coast united in the adoration of a wild species, the coyote,
the <i lang="la">Canis latrans</i> of naturalists.&rsquo; Of the
Dog-demon Chantico the legend of the Nahuas was, &lsquo;that he made a
sacrifice to the gods without observing a preparatory fast, for which
he was punished by being changed into a Dog. He then invoked the god of
death to deliver him, which attempt to evade a just punishment so
enraged the divinities that they immersed the world in
water.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The common phrase &lsquo;hell-hounds&rsquo; has come to us by
various routes. Diana being degraded to Hecate, the dogs of Hades,
Orthros and Cerberus, multiplied into a pack of hounds for her chase,
were degraded with her into infernal howlers and hunters. A like
degradation of Odin&rsquo;s hunt took place at a later date. The Wild
Huntsman, being a diabolical character, is considered elsewhere.
Concerning the Dog, it may be further said here, that there are
probably various characteristics of that animal reflected in his
demonic character. His liability to become rabid, and to afflict human
beings with hydrophobia, appears to have had some part in it. Spinoza
alludes to the custom in his time of destroying persons suffering from
this canine rabies by suffocation; and his English biographer and
editor, Dr. Willis, tells me that in his boyhood in Scotland he always
heard this spoken of as the old custom. That such treatment could have
prevailed can hardly be ascribed to anything but a belief in the
demonic character of the rabid <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140"
href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>dog, cognate with the
unconscious superstition which still causes rural magistrates to order
a dog which has bitten any one to be slain. The notion is, that if the
dog goes mad thereafter, the man will also. Of course it would be
rational to preserve the dog&rsquo;s life carefully, in order that, if
it continues healthy, the bitten may feel reassured, as he cannot be if
it be dead.</p>
<p>But the degradation of the dog had a cause even in his fidelity as a
watch. For this, as we have just seen, made him a common form among
Lares or domestic demons. The teraphim also were often in this shape.
Christianity had therefore a special reason for ascribing an infernal
character to these little idols, which interfered with the popular
dependence on the saints. It will thus be seen that there were many
causes operating to create that formidable class of demons which were
called in the Middle Ages Cynocephaloi. The ancient holy pictures of
Russia especially abound in these dog-headed devils; in the sixteenth
century they were frequently represented rending souls in hell; and
sometimes the dragon of the Apocalypse is represented with seven
horrible canine heads.</p>
<p>M. Toussenel, in his transcendental interpretations, has identified
the Wolf as the bandit and outlaw.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2868src"
href="#xd26e2868" name="xd26e2868src">15</a> The proverbial
medi&aelig;val phrase for an outlaw&mdash;one who wears a <i lang=
"xx">teste l&oelig;ve, caput lupinum, wulfesheofod</i>, which the
ingenious author perhaps remembered&mdash;is of good antiquity. The
wolf is called robber in the &lsquo;Rig-Veda,&rsquo; and he is there
also demonised, since we find him fleeing before a devotee. (In the
Zend &lsquo;Vendidad&rsquo; the souls of the pious fear to meet the
wolf on the way to heaven.) The god Pushan is invoked against the evil
wolf, the malignant spirit.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2874src" href=
"#xd26e2874" name="xd26e2874src">16</a> Cardano says <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>that
to dream of a wolf announces a robber. There is in the wolf, at the
same time, that always attractive love of liberty which, in the
well-known fable, makes him prefer leanness to the comfort of the
collar-wearing dog, which makes him among demonic animals sometimes the
same as the mighty huntsmen Nimrod and shaggy Esau among humanised
demons. One is not surprised to find occasionally good stories about
the wolf. Thus the Nez Perces tribe in America trace the origin of the
human race to a wolf. They say that originally, when there were nothing
but animals, there was a huge monster which devoured them whole and
alive. This monster swallowed a wolf, who, when he entered its belly,
found the animals therein snarling at and biting one another as they
had done on the earth outside. The wolf exhorted them that their common
sufferings should teach them friendliness, and finally he induced them
to a system of co-operation by which they made their way out through
the side of the monster, which instantly perished. The animals so
released were at once transformed to men, how and why the advocates of
co-operation will readily understand, and founded the Nez Perces
Indians. The myths of Asia and Europe are unhappily antipodal to this
in spirit and form, telling of human beings transformed to wolves. In
the Norse Mythology, however, there stands a demon wolf whose story
bears a touch of feeling, though perhaps it was originally the mere
expression for physical law. This is the wolf Fenris, which, from being
at first the pet of the gods and lapdog of the goddesses, became so
huge and formidable that Asgard itself was endangered. All the skill
and power of the gods could not forge chains which might chain him; he
snapped them like straws and toppled over the mountains to which he was
fastened. But the little Elves working underground <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>made
that chain so fine that none could see or feel it,&mdash;fashioned it
out of the beards of women, the breath of fish, noise of the
cat&rsquo;s footfall, spittle of birds, sinews of bears, roots of
stones,&mdash;by which are meant things non-existent. This held him.
Fenris is chained till the final destruction, when he shall break loose
and devour Odin. The fine chain that binds ferocity,&mdash;is it the
love that can tame all creatures? Is it the sunbeam that defines to the
strongest creature its habitat?</p>
<p>The two monsters formed when R&aacute;hu was cloven in twain, in
Hindu Mythology, reappear in Eddaic fable as the wolves Sk&ouml;ll and

<p class="first">Euphemism attending propitiation of such monsters may
partly explain the many good things told of wolves in popular legend.
The stories of the she-wolf nourishing children, as Romulus and Remus,
are found in many lands. They must, indeed, have had some prestige, to
have been so largely adopted in saintly tradition. Like the bears that
Elisha called to devour the children, the wolves do not lose their
natural ferocity by becoming pious. They devour heretics and
sacrilegious people. One guarded the head of St. Edmund the Martyr of
England; another escorted St. Oddo, Abbot of Cluny, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>his
ancestors did the priests of Cluny. The skin of the wolf appears in
folklore as a charm against hydrophobia; its teeth are best for cutting
children&rsquo;s gums, and its bite, if survived, is an assurance
against any future wound or pain.</p>

</div>
<p>The tragedy which is so foolishly sprung upon the nerves of
children, Little Red Riding-Hood, shows the wolf as a crafty animal.
There are many legends of a like character which have made it a
favourite figure in which to represent pious impostors. In our figure
10, the wolf appears as the &lsquo;dangerous confessor;&rsquo; it was
intended, as Mr. Wright thought, for Mary of Modena, Queen of James
II., and Father Petre. At the top of the original are the words
&lsquo;<i>Converte Angliam</i>&rsquo; and beneath, &lsquo;It is a
foolish sheep that makes the wolf her confessor.&rsquo; The craft of
the wolf is represented in a partly political partly social turn given
by an American fabulist to one of &AElig;sop&rsquo;s fables.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>The wolf having accused the lamb he means to
devour of fouling the stream, and receiving answer that the lamb was
drinking farther down the current, alters the charge and says,
&lsquo;You opposed my candidature at the caucus two years ago.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I was not then born,&rsquo; replies the lamb. The wolf then
says, &lsquo;Any one hearing my accusations would testify that I am
insane and not responsible for my actions,&rsquo; and thereupon devours
the lamb with full faith in a jury of his countrymen. M. Toussenel says
the wolf is a terrible strategist, albeit the less observant have found
little in his character to warrant this attribute of craft, his
physiognomy and habits showing him a rather transparent highwayman. It
is probable that the fables of this character have derived that trait
from his association with demons and devils supposed to take on his
shape.</p>
<p>In a beautiful hymn to the Earth in the &lsquo;Atharva Veda&rsquo;
it is said, &lsquo;The Earth, which endureth the burden of the
oppressor, beareth up the abode of the lofty and of the lowly,
suffereth the hog, and giveth entrance to the wild boar.&rsquo;
Boar-hounds in Brittany and some other regions are still kept at
Government expense. There are many indications of this kind that in
early times men had to defend themselves vigorously against the ravages
of the wild boar, and, as De Gubernatis remarks,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2927src" href="#xd26e2927" name="xd26e2927src">17</a> its
character is generally demoniacal. The contests of Hercules with the
Erymanthian, and of Meleager with the Calydonian, Boar, are enough to
show that it was through its dangerous character that he became sacred
to the gods of war, Mars and Odin. But it is also to be remembered that
the third incarnation of Vishnu was as a Wild Boar; and as the fearless
exterminator of snakes the pig merited this association with the
Preserver. Provided with a thick coat of fat, no venom can harm him
unless it be on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145"
name="pb145">145</a>]</span>lip. It may be this ability to defy the
snake-ordeal which, after its uncleanliness had excepted the hog from
human voracity in some regions, assigned it a diabolical character. In
rabbinical fable the hog and rat were created by Noah to clear the Ark
of filth; but the rats becoming a nuisance, he evoked a cat from the
lion&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>It is clear that our Asiatic and Norse ancestors never had such a
ferocious beast to encounter as the Grisly Bear (<i lang="la">Ursus
horribilis</i>) of America, else the appearances of this animal in
Demonology could never have been so respectable. The comparatively
timid Asiatic Bear (<i lang="la">U. labiatus</i>), the small and almost
harmless Thibetan species (<i lang="la">U. Thibetanus</i>), would
appear to have preponderated over the fiercer but rarer Bears of the
North in giving us the Indo-Germanic fables, in which this animal is,
on the whole, a favourite. Emerson finds in the fondness of the English
for their national legend of &lsquo;Beauty and the Beast&rsquo; a sign
of the Englishman&rsquo;s own nature. &lsquo;He is a bear with a soft
place in his heart; he says No, and helps you.&rsquo; The old legend
found place in the heart of a particularly representative American
also&mdash;Theodore Parker, who loved to call his dearest friend
&lsquo;Bear,&rsquo; and who, on arriving in Europe, went to Berne to
see his favourites, from which its name is derived. The fondness of the
Bear for honey&mdash;whence its Russian name, <i>medv-jed</i>,
&lsquo;honey-eater&rsquo;&mdash;had probably something to do with its
dainty taste for roses and its admiration for female beauty, as told in
many myths. In his comparative treatment of the mythology of the Bear,
De Gubernatis<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2946src" href="#xd26e2946"
name="xd26e2946src">18</a> mentions the transformation of King
Trisankus into a bear, and connects this with the constellation of the
Great Bear; but it may with equal probability be related to the many
fables of princes who remain under the form of a bear <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>until the spell is broken by the kiss of some
maiden. It is worthy of note that in the Russian legends the Bear is by
no means so amiable as in those of our Western folklore. In one, the
Bear-prince lurking in his fountain holds by the beard the king who,
while hunting, tries to quench his thirst, and releases him only after
a promise to deliver up whatever he has at home without his knowledge;
the twins, Ivan and Maria, born during his absence, are thus
doomed&mdash;are concealed, but discovered by the bear, who carries
them away. They are saved by help of the bull. When escaping the bear
Ivan throws down a comb, which becomes a tangled forest, which,
however, the bear penetrates; but the spread-out towel which becomes a
lake of fire sends the bear back.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2954src"
href="#xd26e2954" name="xd26e2954src">19</a> It is thus the ferocious
Arctic Bear which gives the story its sombre character. Such also is
the Russian tale of the Bear with iron hairs, which devastates the
kingdom, devouring the inhabitants until Ivan and Helena alone remain;
after the two in various ways try to escape, their success is secured
by the Bull, which, more kindly than Elisha, blinds the Bear with his
horns.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2957src" href="#xd26e2957" name=
"xd26e2957src">20</a> (The Bear retires in winter.) In Norwegian story
the Bear becomes milder,&mdash;a beautiful youth by night, whose wife
loses him because she wishes to see him by lamplight: her place is
taken by a long-nosed princess, until, by aid of the golden apple and
the rose, she recovers her husband. In the Pentameron,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2960src" href="#xd26e2960" name=
"xd26e2960src">21</a> Pretiosa, to escape the persecutions of her
father, goes into the forest disguised as a she-bear; she nurses and
cures the prince, who is enamoured of her, and at his kiss becomes a
beautiful maid. The Bear thus has a twofold development in folklore. He
used to be killed (13th century) at the end of the Carnival in Rome, as
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>Devil.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2965src" href=
"#xd26e2965" name="xd26e2965src">22</a> The Siberians, if they have
killed a bear, hang his skin on a tree and apologise humbly to it,
declaring that they did not forge the metal that pierced it, and they
meant the arrow for a bird; from which it is plain that they rely more
on its stupidity than its good heart. In Canada, when the hunters kill
a bear, one of them approaches it and places between his teeth the stem
of his pipe, breathes in the bowl, and thus, filling with smoke the
animal&rsquo;s mouth, conjures its soul not to be offended at his
death. As the bear&rsquo;s ghost makes no reply, the huntsman, in order
to know if his prayer is granted, cuts the thread under the
bear&rsquo;s tongue, and keeps it until the end of the hunt, when a
large fire is kindled, and all the band solemnly throw in it what
threads of this kind they have; if these sparkle and vanish, as is
natural, it is a sign that the bears are appeased.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2972src" href="#xd26e2972" name="xd26e2972src">23</a> In
Greenland the great demon, at once feared and invoked, especially by
fishermen, is Torngarsuk, a huge Bear with a human arm. He is invisible

<p>The extreme point of demonic power has always been held by the
Serpent. So much, however, will have to be said of the destructiveness
and other characteristics of this animal when we come to consider at
length its unique position in Mythology, that I content myself here
with a pictorial representation of the Singhalese Demon of Serpents. If
any one find himself shuddering at sight of a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>snake, even in a country where they are few and
comparatively harmless, perhaps this figure (<a href="#fig11">11</a>)
may suggest the final cause of the shudder.</p>
<div class="figure fig11width" id="fig11"><img src="images/fig111.jpg"

</div>
<p>In conclusion, it may be said that not only every animal ferocity,
but every force which can be exerted injuriously, has had its demonic
representations. Every claw, fang, sting, hoof, horn, has been as
certain to be catalogued and labelled in demonology as in physical
science. It is remarkable also how superstition rationalises. Thus the
horn in the animal world, though sometimes dangerous to man, was more
dangerous to animals, which, as foes of the horned animals, were foes
to man&rsquo;s interests. The early herdsman knew the value of the horn
as a defence against dog and wolf, besides its other utilities.
Consequently, although it was necessary that the horn-principle, so to
say, in nature must be regarded as one of its retractile and cruel
features, man never demonised the animals whose butt was most
dangerous, but for such purpose transferred <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>the
horns to the head of some nondescript creature. The horn has thus
become a natural weapon of man-demons. The same evolution has taken
place in America; for, although among its aboriginal legends we may
meet with an occasional demon-buffalo, such are rare and of apocryphal
antiquity. The accompanying American figure (<a href="#fig12">12</a>)
is from a photograph sent me by the President of Vanderbilt University,
Tennessee, who found it in an old mound (Red Indian) in the State of
Georgia. It is probably as ancient as any example of a human head with
horns in the world; and as it could not have been influenced by
European notions, it supplies striking evidence that the demonisation
of the forces and dangers of nature belongs to the structural action of
the human mind.</p>

<p class="first">We paint the Devil black, says George Herbert. On the
other hand the negro paints him white, with reason enough. The name of
the Devil at Mozambique is Muzungu Maya, or Wicked White Man. Of this
demon they make little images of extreme hideousness, which are kept by
people on the coast, and occasionally displayed, in the belief that if
the White Devil is lurking near them he will vanish out of sheer
disgust with a glimpse of his own ugliness. The hereditary horror of
the kidnapper displayed in this droll superstition may possibly have
been assisted by the familiarity with all things infernal represented
in the language of the white sailors visiting the coast. Captain Basil
Hall, on visiting Mozambique about fifty years ago, found that the
native dignitaries had appropriated the titles of English noblemen, and
a dumpy little Duke of Devonshire met him with his whole vocabulary of
English,&mdash;&lsquo;How do you do, sir. Very glad see you. Damn your
eyes. Johanna man like English very much. God damn. That very good? Eh?
Devilish hot, sir. What news? Hope your ship stay too long while very.
Damn my eye. Very fine day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In most parts of India Siva also is painted white, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>would indicate that there too was found reason
to associate diabolism with the white face. It is said the Thugs spared
Englishmen because their white faces suggested relationship to Siva. In
some of the ancient Indian books the monster whom Indra slew, Vritra,
is called Dasyu (enemy), a name which in the Vedas designates the
Aborigines as contrasted with the Aryans of the North. In the old
Sanskrit, in the hymns of the Veda, &acirc;rya occurs frequently as a
national name and as a name of honour, comprising the worshippers of
the gods of the Brahmans, as opposed to their enemies, who are called
in the Veda Dasyus. Thus one of the gods, Indra, who in some respects
answers to the Greek Zeus, is invoked in the following words (Rigveda,
i. 57, 8):&mdash;&lsquo;Know thou the Aryas, O Indra, and those who are
Dasyus; punish the lawless, and deliver them unto thy servant! Be thou
the mighty helper of the worshippers, and I will praise all these thy
deeds at the festivals.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3020src"
href="#xd26e3020" name="xd26e3020src">1</a></p>
<p>Naglok (snakeland) was at an early period a Hindu name for hell. But
the Nagas were not real snakes,&mdash;in that case they might have
fared better,&mdash;but an aboriginal tribe in Ceylon, believed by the
Hindus to be of serpent origin,&mdash;&lsquo;naga&rsquo; being an
epithet for &lsquo;native.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3025src"
href="#xd26e3025" name="xd26e3025src">2</a> The Singhalese, on the
other hand, have adapted the popular name for demons in India,
&lsquo;Rakshasa,&rsquo; in their <i>Rakseyo</i>, a tribe of invisible
cannibals without supernatural powers (except invisibility), who no
doubt merely embody the traditions of some early race. The dreaded
powers were from another tribe designated Yakkhos (demons), and
believed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>to have the power of rendering themselves
invisible. Buddha&rsquo;s victories over these demonic beings are
related in the &lsquo;Mahawanso.&rsquo; &lsquo;It was known (by
inspiration) by the vanquishers that in Lanka, filled by yakkhos,
&hellip; would be the place where his religion would be glorified. In
like manner, knowing that in the centre of Lanka, on the delightful
bank of a river, &hellip; in the agreeable Mahanaga garden, &hellip;
there was a great assembly of the principal yakkhos, &hellip; the deity
of happy advent, approaching that great congregation, &hellip;
immediately over their heads hovering in the air, &hellip; struck
terror into them by rains, tempests, and darkness. The yakkhos,
overwhelmed with awe, supplicated of the vanquisher to be released from
their terror&#8202;&hellip;. The consoling vanquisher thus replied:
&lsquo;I will release ye yakkhos from this your terror and affliction:
give ye unto me here by unanimous consent a place for me to alight
on.&rsquo; All these yakkhos replied: &lsquo;Lord, we confer on thee
the whole of Lanka, grant thou comfort to us.&rsquo; The vanquisher
thereupon dispelling their terror and cold shivering, and spreading his
carpet of skin on the spot bestowed on him, he there seated himself. He
then caused the aforesaid carpet, refulgent with a fringe of flames, to
extend itself on all sides: they, scorched by the flames, (receding)
stood around on the shores (of the island) terrified. The Saviour then
caused the delightful isle of Giri to approach for them. As soon as
they transferred themselves thereto (to escape the conflagration), he
restored it to its former position.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=

<p>This legend, which reminds one irresistibly of the expulsion of
reptiles by saints from Ireland, and other Western regions, is the more
interesting if it be considered that these Yakkhos are the Sanskrit
Yakshas, attendants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span>on Kuvera, the god of wealth, employed in
the care of his garden and treasures. They are regarded as generally
inoffensive. The transfer by English authorities of the Tasmanians from
their native island to another, with the result of their extermination,
may suggest the possible origin of the story of Giri.</p>
<p>Buddha&rsquo;s dealings with the serpent-men or nagas is related as
follows in the same volume:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The vanquisher (<i>i.e.</i>, of the five deadly sins),
&hellip; in the fifth year of his buddhahood, while residing at the
garden of (the prince) Jeto, observing that, on account of a disputed
claim for a gem-set throne between the naga Mahodaro and a similar
Chalodaro, a maternal uncle and nephew, a conflict was at hand,
&hellip; taking with him his sacred dish and robes, out of compassion
to the nagas, visited Nagadipo&#8202;&hellip;. These mountain nagas
were, moreover, gifted with supernatural powers&#8202;&hellip;. The
Saviour and dispeller of the darkness of sin, poising himself in the
air over the centre of the assembly, caused a terrifying darkness to
these nagas. Attending to the prayer of the dismayed nagas, he again
called forth the light of day. They, overjoyed at having seen the deity
of felicitous advent, bowed down at the feet of the divine teacher. To
them the vanquisher preached a sermon of reconciliation. Both parties
rejoicing thereat, made an offering of the gem-throne to the divine
sage. The divine teacher, alighting on the earth, seated himself on the
throne, and was served by the naga kings with celestial food and
beverage. The lord of the universe procured for eighty kotis of nagas,
dwelling on land and in the waters, the salvation of the faith and the
state of piety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At every step in the conversion of the native Singhalese,&mdash;the
demons and serpent-men,&mdash;Buddha and his apostles are represented
as being attended by the <i>devas</i>,&mdash;the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>deities of India,&mdash;who are spoken of as if
glad to become menials of the new religion. But we find Zoroaster using
this term in a demonic sense, and describing alien worshippers as
children of the Devas (a Semite would say, Sons of Belial). And in the
conventional Persian pictures of the Last Judgment (moslem), the
archfiend has the Hindu complexion. A similar phenomenon may be
observed in various regions. In the medi&aelig;val frescoes of Moscow,
representing infernal tortures, it is not very difficult to pick out
devils representing the physical characteristics of most of the races
with which the Muscovite has struggled in early times. There are also
black Ethiopians among them, which may be a result of devils being
considered the brood of Tchernibog, god of Darkness; but may also, not
impossibly, have come of such apocryphal narratives as that ascribed to
St. Augustine. &lsquo;I was already Bishop of Hippo when I went into
Ethiopia with some servants of Christ, there to preach the gospel. In
this country we saw many men and women without heads, who had two great
eyes in their breasts; and in countries still more southerly we saw a
people who had but one eye in their foreheads.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"

<p>In considering animal demons, the primitive demonisation of the Wolf
has been discussed. But it is mainly as a transformation of man and a
type of savage foes that this animal has been a prominent figure in
Mythology.</p>
<p>Professor Max M&uuml;ller has made it tolerably clear that
Bellerophon means Slayer of the Hairy; and that Belleros is the
transliteration of Sanskrit <i>varvara</i>, a term applied to the dark
Aborigines by their Aryan invaders, equivalent to barbarians.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3068src" href="#xd26e3068" name="xd26e3068src">5</a>
This points us for the origin of the title rather to
Bellerophon&rsquo;s conquest of the Lycians, or Wolf-men, than to his
victory over the Chim&aelig;ra. The story of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>Lycaon and his sons&mdash;barbarians defying the
gods and devouring human flesh&mdash;turned into wolves by Zeus,
connects itself with the Lycians (hairy, wolfish barbarians), whom
Bellerophon conquered.</p>
<p>It was not always, however, the deity that conquered in such
encounters. In the myth of Soracte, the Wolf is seen able to hold his
own against the gods. Soranus, worshipped on Mount Soracte, was at Rome
the god of Light, and is identified with Apollo by Virgil.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3075src" href="#xd26e3075" name="xd26e3075src">6</a>
A legend states that he became associated with the infernal gods,
though called Diespiter, because of the sulphurous exhalations from the
side of Mount Soracte. It is said that once when some shepherds were
performing a sacrifice, some wolves seized the flesh; the shepherds,
following them, were killed by the poisonous vapours of the mountain to
which the wolves retreated. An oracle gave out that this was a
punishment for their pursuing the sacred animals; and a general
pestilence also having followed, it was declared that it could only
cease if the people were all changed to wolves and lived by prey. Hence
the Hirpini, from the Sabine &lsquo;<i>hirpus</i>,&rsquo; a wolf. The
story is a variant of that of the Hirpinian Samnites, who were said to
have received their name from their ancestors having followed a sacred
wolf when seeking their new home. The Wolf ceremonies were, like the
Roman Lupercalia, for purposes of purification. The worshippers ran
naked through blazing fires. The annual festival, which Strabo
describes as occurring in the grove of Feronia, goddess of Nature,
became at last a sort of fair. Its history, however, is very
significant of the formidable character of the Hirpini, or Wolf-tribe,
which could alone have given rise to such euphemistic celebrations of
the wolf.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in some regions this wolf
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>of superstition was domesticated into a dog.
Pierius says there was a temple of Vulcan in Mount &AElig;tna, in whose
grove were dogs that fawned on the pious, but rent the polluted
worshippers. It will be seen by the left form of <a href="#fig13">Fig.
13</a> that the wolf had a diminution, in pictorial representation
similar to that which the canine Lares underwent (p. 135). This picture
is referred by John Beaumont<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3091src" href=
"#xd26e3091" name="xd26e3091src">7</a> to Cartarius&rsquo; work on
&lsquo;The Images of the Gods of the Ancients;&rsquo; the form wearing
a wolf&rsquo;s skin and head is that of the demon Polites, who infested
Temesa in Italy, according to a story related by Pausanias. Ulysses, in
his wanderings, having come to this town, one of his companions was
stoned to death for having ravished a virgin; after which his ghost
appeared in form of this demon, which had to be appeased, by the
direction of the oracle of Apollo, by the annual sacrifice to him of
the most beautiful virgin in the place. Euthymus, enamoured of a virgin
about to be so offered, gave battle to this demon, and, having expelled
him from the country, married the virgin. However, since the infernal
powers cannot be deprived of their rights without substitution, this
saviour of Temesa disappeared in the river C&aelig;cinus.</p>

<p>The form on the right in <a href="#fig13">Fig. 13</a> represents the
genius of the city of Rome, and is found on some of Hadrian&rsquo;s
coins; he holds the cornucopia and the sacrificial dish. The child and
the serpent in the same picture represent the origin of the demonic
character attributed to the Eleans by the Arcadians. This
child-and-serpent symbol, which bears resemblance to certain variants
of Bel and the Dragon, no doubt was brought to Elea, or Velia in Italy,
by the Phoc&aelig;ans, when they abandoned their Ionian homes rather
than submit to Cyrus, and founded that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>town, <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> 544. The two forms were jointly worshipped with annual
sacrifices in the temple of Lucina, under the name Sosipolis. The
legend of this title is related by Pausanias. When the Arcadians
invaded the Eleans, a woman came to the Elean commander with an infant
at her breast, and said that she had been admonished in a dream to
place her child in front of the army. This was done; as the Arcadians
approached the child was changed to a serpent, and, astounded at the
prodigy, they fled without giving battle. The child was represented by
the Eleans decorated with stars, and holding the cornucopia; by the
Arcadians, no doubt, in a less celestial way. It is not uncommon in
Mythology to find the most dangerous demons represented under some
guise of weakness, as, for instance, among the South Africans, some of
whom recently informed English officers that the Galeikas were led
against them by a terrible sorcerer in the form of a hare. The most
fearful traditional demon ever slain by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>hero in Japan was
Shuden Dozi&mdash;the Child-faced Drinker. In Ceylon the apparition of
a demon is said to be frequently under the form of a woman with a child
in her arms.</p>
<p>Many animal demons are mere fables for the ferocity of human tribes.
The Were-wolf superstition, which exists still in Russia, where the
transformed monster is called <i>volkodl&aacute;k</i> (<i>volk</i>, a
wolf, and <i>dlak</i>, hair), might even have originated in the costume
of Norse barbarians and huntsmen. The belief was always more or less
rationalised, resembling that held by Verstegan three hundred years
ago, and which may be regarded as prevalent among both the English and
Flemish people of his day. &lsquo;These Were-wolves,&rsquo; he says,
&lsquo;are certain sorcerers, who, having anointed their bodies with an
ointment they make by the instinct of the devil, and putting on a
certain enchanted girdle, do not only unto the view of others seem as
wolves, but to their own thinking have both the nature and shape of
wolves so long as they wear the said girdle; and they do dispose
themselves as very wolves, in worrying and killing, and waste of human
creatures.&rsquo; During the Franco-German war of 1870&ndash;71, a
family of ladies on the German side of the Rhine, sitting up all night
in apprehension, related to me such stories of the &lsquo;Turcos&rsquo;
that I have since found no difficulty in understanding the belief in
weird and pr&aelig;ternatural wolves which once filled Europe with
horror. The facility with which the old Lycian wolf-girdle, so to say,
was caught up and worn in so many countries where race-wars were
chronic for many ages, renders it nearly certain that this superstition
(Lycanthropy), however it may have originated, was continued through
the custom of ascribing demonic characteristics to hostile and fierce
races. It has been, indeed, a general opinion that the theoretical
belief originated in the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis. Thus
Shakspere:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"

<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Thou almost <span class="corr" id="xd26e3128" title=

<p class="line">Are wolfish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">But the superstition is much older than Pythagoras,
who, no doubt, tried to turn it into a moral theory of
retributions,&mdash;as indeed did Plato in his story of the Vision of
Er the Armenian.</p>
<p>Professor Weber and others have adduced evidence indicating that
although belief in the transformation of men into beasts was not
developed in the Vedic age of India, the matrix of it was there. But of
our main fact&mdash;the association of demonic characters with certain
tribes&mdash;India has presented many examples. In the mountains of
Travancore there are tribes which are still generally believed to be on
terms of especial familiarity with the devils of that region; and the
dwellers on the plains relate that on these mountains gigantic demons,
sixteen or seventeen feet high, may sometimes be seen hurling
firebrands at each other.</p>
<p>Professor Monier Williams contributes an interesting note concerning
this general phase of South-Indian demonology. &lsquo;Furthermore, it
must not be forgotten that although a belief in devils and homage to
bhutas, or spirits, of all kinds is common all over India, yet what is
called devil-worship is far more systematically practised in the South
of India and Ceylon than in the North. And the reason may be that as
the invading Aryans advanced towards Southern India, they found
portions of it peopled by wild aboriginal savages, whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>behaviour and aspect appeared to them to
resemble that of devils. The Aryan mind, therefore, naturally pictured
to itself the regions of the South as the chief resort and stronghold
of the demon race, and the dread of demonical agency became more deeply
rooted in Southern India than in the North. Curiously enough, too, it
is commonly believed in Southern India that every wicked man
contributes by his death to swell the ever-increasing ranks of devil
legions. His evil passions do not die with him; they are intensified,
concentrated, and perpetuated in the form of a malignant and
mischievous spirit.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3155src" href=
"#xd26e3155" name="xd26e3155src">8</a></p>
<p>It is obvious that this principle may be extended from individuals
to entire tribes. The Cimmerians were regarded as dwelling in a land
allied with hell. In the legend of the Alhambra, as told by Washington
Irving, the astrologer warns the Moorish king that the beautiful damsel
is no doubt one of those Gothic sorceresses of whom they have heard so
much. Although, as we have seen, England was regarded on the Continent
as an island of demons because of its northern latitude, probably some
of its tribes were of a character dangerous enough to prolong the
superstition. The nightmare elves were believed to come from England,
and to hurry away through the keyholes at daybreak, saying &lsquo;The
bells are calling in England.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3160src" href="#xd26e3160" name="xd26e3160src">9</a> Visigoth
probably left us our word <i>bigot</i>; and &lsquo;Goths and
Vandals&rsquo; sometimes designate English roughs, as
&lsquo;Turks&rsquo; those of Constantinople. Herodotus says the
Scythians of the Black Sea regarded the Neurians as wizards, who
transformed themselves into wolves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>for a few days annually; but
the Scythians themselves are said by Herodotus to have sprung from a
monster, half-woman half-serpent; and possibly the association of the
Scotch with the Scythians by the Germans, who called them both
<i>Scutten</i>, had something to do with the uncanny character ascribed
to the British Isles. Sir Walter Raleigh described the Red Men of
America as gigantic monsters. &lsquo;Red Devils&rsquo; is still the
pioneer&rsquo;s epithet for them in the Far West. The hairy Dukes of
Esau were connected with the goat, and demonised as Edom; and Ishmael
was not believed much better by the more peaceful Semitic tribes. Such
notions are akin to those which many now have of the Thugs and
Bashi-Bazouks, and are too uniform and natural to tax much the
ingenuity of Comparative Mythology.</p>
<p>Underlying many of the legends of giants and dwarfs may be found a
similar demonologic formation. A principle of natural selection would
explain the existence of tribes, which, though of small stature, are
able to hold their own against the larger and more powerful by their
superior cunning. That such equalisation of apparently unequal forces
has been known in pre-historic ages may be gathered from many fables.
Before Bali, the monarch already mentioned, whose power alarmed the
gods themselves, Vishnu appeared as a dwarf, asking only so much land
as he could measure with three steps; the apparently ridiculous request
granted, the god strode over the whole earth with two steps and brought
his third on the head of Bali. In Scandinavian fable we have the young
giantess coming to her mother with the plough and ploughman in her
apron, which she had picked up in the field. To her child&rsquo;s
inquiry, &lsquo;What sort of beetle is this I found wriggling in the
sand?&rsquo; the giantess replies, &lsquo;Go put it back in the place
where thou hast found it. We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>must be gone out of this land, for
these little people will dwell in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Sagas contain many stories which, while written in glorification
of the &lsquo;giant&rsquo; race, relate the destruction of their chiefs
by the magical powers of the dwarfs. I must limit myself to a few notes
on the Ynglinga Saga. &lsquo;In Swithiod,&rsquo; we are told,
&lsquo;are many great domains, and many wonderful races of men, and
many kinds of languages. There are giants, and there are dwarfs, and
there are also blue men. There are wild beasts, and dreadfully large
dragons.&rsquo; We learn that in Asaland was a great chief, Odin, who
went out to conquer Vanaland. The Vanalanders are declared to have
magic arts,&mdash;such as are ascribed to Finns and Lapps to this day
by the more ignorant of their neighbours. But that the people of
Asaland learned their magic charms. &lsquo;Odin was the cleverest of
them all, and from him all the others learned their magic arts.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Odin could make his enemies in battle blind, or deaf, or
terror-struck, and their weapons so blunt that they could no more cut
than a willow twig; on the other hand, his men rushed forward without
armour, were as mad as dogs or wolves, bit their shields, and were as
strong as bears or wild bulls, and killed people at a blow, and neither
fire nor iron told upon them. These were called Berserkers.&rsquo;
(From <i>ber</i>, bear, and <i>serkr</i>, sark or coat; the word being
probably, as Maurer says, a survival of an earlier belief in the
transformation of men into bears.) But the successors of Odin did not
preserve his occult power. Svegdir, for instance, saw a large stone and
a dwarf at the door entering in it. The dwarf called him to come in and
he should see Odin. &lsquo;Swedger ran into the stone, which instantly
closed behind him, and Swedger never came back.&rsquo; The witchcraft
of the Finn people is said to have led Vanlandi (Svegdir&rsquo;s son)
to his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>death by Mara (night-mare). Vanlandi&rsquo;s son
too, Visbur, fell a victim to sorcery. Such legends as these, and many
others which may be found in Sturleson&rsquo;s Heimskringla, have
influenced our popular stories whose interest turns on the skill with
which some little Jack or Thumbling overcomes his adversary by superior
cunning.</p>
<p>Superstitions concerning dwarf-powers are especially rife in
Northumberland, where they used to be called <i>Duergar</i>, and they
were thought to abound on the hills between Rothbury and Elsdon. They
mislead with torches. One story relates that a traveller, beguiled at
night into a hut where a dwarf prepared a comfortable fire for him,
found himself when daylight returned sitting upon the edge of a deep
rugged precipice, where the slightest movement had caused him to be
dashed to pieces.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3212src" href="#xd26e3212"
name="xd26e3212src">10</a> The Northumbrian stories generally, however,
do not bear the emphasis of having grown out of aboriginal conditions,
or even of having been borrowed for such. The legends of Scotland, and
of the South-West of England, appear to me much more suggestive of
original struggles between large races and small. They are recalled by
the superstitions which still linger in Norway concerning the Lapps,
who are said to carry on unholy dealings with gnomes.</p>
<p>In the last century the &lsquo;Brownie&rsquo; was commonly spoken of
in Scotland as appearing in shape of &lsquo;a tall man,&rsquo; and the
name seems to refer to the <i>brown</i> complexion of that bogey, and
its long brown hair, hardly Scottish.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3220src" href="#xd26e3220" name="xd26e3220src">11</a> It is
generally the case that Second Sight, which once attained the dignity
of being called &lsquo;Deuteroscopia,&rsquo; sees a doomed man or woman
shrink to the size of a dwarf. The &lsquo;tall man&rsquo; is not far
off in such cases. &lsquo;In some age of the world more remote than
even that of Alypos,&rsquo; says <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>Hugh Miller, &lsquo;the whole
of Britain was peopled by giants&mdash;a fact amply supported by early
English historians and the traditions of the North of Scotland.
Diocletian, king of Syria, say the historians, had thirty-three
daughters, who, like the daughters of Danaus, killed their husbands on
their wedding night. The king, their father, in abhorrence of the
crime, crowded them all into a ship, which he abandoned to the mercy of
the waves, and which was drifted by tides and winds till it arrived on
the coast of Britain, then an uninhabited island. There they lived
solitary, subsisting on roots and berries, the natural produce of the
soil, until an order of demons, becoming enamoured of them, took them
for their wives; and a tribe of giants, who must be regarded as the
true aborigines of the country, if indeed the demons have not a prior
claim, were the fruit of these marriages. Less fortunate, however, than
even their prototypes the Cyclops, the whole tribe was extirpated a few
ages after by Brutus the parricide, who, with a valour to which mere
bulk could offer no effectual resistance, overthrew Gog-Magog and
Termagol, and a whole host of others with names equally terrible.
Tradition is less explicit than the historians in what relates to the
origin and extinction of the race, but its narratives of their prowess
are more minute. There is a large and ponderous stone in the parish of
Edderston which a giantess of the tribe is said to have flung from the
point of a spindle across the Dornoch Firth; and another, within a few
miles of Dingwall, still larger and more ponderous, which was thrown by
a person of the same family, and which still bears the marks of a
gigantic finger and thumb.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3225src"
href="#xd26e3225" name="xd26e3225src">12</a></p>
<p>Perhaps we may find the mythological descendants of these Titans,
and also of the Druids, in the so-called <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>&lsquo;Great
Men&rsquo; once dreaded by Highlanders. The natives of South Uist
believed that a valley, called Glenslyte, situated between two
mountains on the east side of the island, was haunted by these Great
Men, and that if any one entered the valley without formally resigning
themselves to the conduct of those beings, they would infallibly become
mad. Martin, having remonstrated with the people against this
superstition, was told of a woman&rsquo;s having come out of the valley
a lunatic because she had not uttered the spell of three sentences.
They also told him of voices heard in the air. The Brownie (&lsquo;a
tall man with very long brown hair&rsquo;), who has cow&rsquo;s milk
poured out for him on a hill in the same region, probably of this giant
tribe, might easily have been demonised at the time when the Druids
were giving St. Columba so much trouble, and trying to retain their
influence over the people by professing supernatural powers.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3232src" href="#xd26e3232" name=
"xd26e3232src">13</a></p>
<p>The man of the smaller stature, making up for his inferiority by
invention, perhaps first forged the sword, the coat of mail, and the
shield, and so confronted the giant with success. The god with the
Hammer might thus supersede the god of the Flint Spear. Magic art
seemed to have rendered invulnerable the man from whom the arrow
rebounded.</p>
<p>It would appear from King Olaf Tryggvason&rsquo;s Saga that nine
hundred years ago the Icelanders and the Danes reciprocally regarded
each other as giants and dwarfs. The Icelanders indited lampoons
against the Danes which allude to their diminutive size:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">The gallant Harald in the field</p>

<p class="first">On the other hand, the Danes had by no means a
contemptuous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>idea of their Icelandic enemies, as the
following narrative from Heimskringla proves. &lsquo;King Harald told a
warlock to hie to Iceland in some altered shape, and to try what he
could learn there to tell him: and he set out in the shape of a whale.
And when he came near to the land he went to the west side of Iceland,
north around the land, when he saw all the mountains and hills full of
land-serpents, some great, some small. When he came to Vapnafiord he
went in towards the land, intending to go on shore; but a huge dragon
rushed down the dale against him, with a train of serpents, paddocks,
and toads, that blew poison towards him. Then he turned to go westward
around the land as far as Eyafiord, and he went into the fiord. Then a
bird flew against him, which was so great that its wings stretched over
the mountains on either side of the fiord, and many birds, great and
small, with it. Then he swam further west, and then south into
Breidafiord. When he came into the fiord a large grey bull ran against
him, wading into the sea, and bellowing fearfully, and he was followed
by a crowd of land-serpents. From thence he went round by Reikaness and
wanted to land at Vikarsted, but there came down a hill-giant against
him with an iron staff in his hands. He was a head higher than the
mountains, and many other giants followed him.&rsquo; The most
seductive Hesperian gardens of the South and East do not appear to have
been so thoroughly guarded or defended as Iceland, and one can hardly
call it cowardice when (after the wizard-whale brought back the log of
its voyage) it is recorded: &lsquo;Then the Danish king turned about
with his fleet and sailed back to Denmark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is a sufficiently curious fact that the Mimacs, aborigines of
Nova Scotia,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3252src" href="#xd26e3252"
name="xd26e3252src">14</a> were found with a whale-story, already
referred to (p. 46), so much like this. They also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>have
the legend of an ancient warrior named Booin, who possessed the
pr&aelig;ternatural powers especially ascribed to Odin, those of
raising storms, causing excessive cold, increasing or diminishing his
size, and assuming any shape. Besides the fearful race of gigantic
ice-demons dreaded by this tribe, as elsewhere stated (p. 84), they
dread also a yellow-horned dragon called Cheepichealm, (whose form the
great Booin sometimes assumes). They make offerings to the new moon.
They believe in pixies, calling them Wigguladum-moochkik, &lsquo;very
little people.&rsquo; They anciently believed in two great spirits,
good and evil, both called Manitoos; since their contact with
christians only the evil one has been so called.</p>
<p>The entire <i>motif</i> of the Mimac Demonology is, to my mind, that
of early conflicts with some formidable races. It is to be hoped that
travellers will pay more attention to this unique race before it has
ceased to exist. The Chinese theory of genii is almost exactly that of
the Mimacs. The Chinese genii are now small as a moth, now fill the
world; can assume any form; they command demons; they never die, but,
at the end of some centuries, ride to heaven on a dragon&rsquo;s
back.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3262src" href="#xd26e3262" name=
"xd26e3262src">15</a> Ordinarily the Chinese genii use the yellow heron
as an aerial courser. The Mimacs believe in a large pr&aelig;ternatural
water-bird, Culloo, which devours ordinary people, but bears on its
back those who can tame it by magic.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayers, in his &lsquo;Chinese Reader&rsquo;s Manual,&rsquo;
suggests that the designation of Formosa as &lsquo;Isles of the
Genii&rsquo; (San Sh&eacute;n Shan) by the Chinese, has some reference
to their early attempts at colonisation in Japan. Su Fuh, a
necromancer, who lived B.C. 219, is said to have announced their
discovery, and at the head of a troop of young men and maidens, voyaged
with an expedition towards them, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168"
href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>but, when within sight of the
magic islands, were driven back by contrary winds.</p>
<p>Gog and Magog stand in London Guildhall, though much diminished in
stature, to suit the English muscles that had to bear them in
processions, monuments of the pr&aelig;ternatural size attributed to
the enemies which the Aryan race encountered in its great westward
migrations. Even to-day, when the progress of civilisation is harassed
by untamed Scythian hordes, how strangely fall upon our ears the
ancient legends and prophecies concerning them!</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah:</p>
<p class="line">Behold I am against thee, O Gog,</p>
<p class="line">Prince of Rosh, of Meshech, and of Tubul:</p>
<p class="line">And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part

<p class="first">In the Koran it is related of
Dhulkarnein:&mdash;&lsquo;He journeyed from south to north until he
came between the two mountains, beneath which he found a people who
could scarce understand what was said. And they said, O Dhulkarnein,
verily Gog and Magog waste the land; shall we, therefore, pay thee
tribute, on condition that thou build a rampart between us and them? He
answered, The power wherewith my Lord hath strengthened me is better
than your tribute; but assist me strenuously and I will set a strong
wall between you and them&#8202;&hellip;. Wherefore when this wall was
finished, Gog and Magog could not scale it, neither could they dig
through it. And Dhulkarnein said, This is a mercy from my Lord; but
when the prediction of my Lord shall come to be fulfilled, he will
reduce the wall to dust.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169"

his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the
four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them in battle:

Sir John Maundeville was telling in England the legend he had heard in
the East. &lsquo;<span lang="en">In that same regioun ben the

<p class="first">In their adoration of rain-giving Indra as also a
solar majesty, the ancient Hindus seem to have been fully aware of his
inconsistent habits. &lsquo;Thy inebriety is most intense,&rsquo;
exclaims the eulogist, and soothingly adds, &lsquo;Thou desirest that
both thy inebriety and thy beneficence should be the means of
destroying enemies and distributing riches.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3331src" href="#xd26e3331" name="xd26e3331src">1</a> Against
famine is invoked the thunderbolt of Indra, and it is likened to the
terrible Tvashtri, in whose fearful shape (pure fire) Agni once
appeared to the terror of gods and men.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3334src" href="#xd26e3334" name="xd26e3334src">2</a> This
Tvashtri was not an evil being himself, but, as we have seen, an
artificer for the gods similar to Vulcan; he was, however, father of a
three-headed monster who has been identified with Vritra. Though these
early worshippers recognised that their chief trouble was connected
with &lsquo;glaring heat&rsquo; (which Tvashtri seems to mean in the
passage just referred to), Indra&rsquo;s celebrants beheld him
superseding his father Dyaus, and reigning in the day&rsquo;s splendour
as well as in the cloud&rsquo;s bounty. This monopolist of parts in
their theogony <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=

pervaded with stories of the demons that arrested the rain and stole
the cloud-cows of Indra&mdash;shutting them away in caves,&mdash;and
the god is endlessly praised for dealing death to such. He slays
Vritra, the &lsquo;rain-arresting,&rsquo; and Dribhika, Bala, Urana,
Arbuda, &lsquo;devouring Swasna,&rsquo; &lsquo;unabsorbable
S&uacute;shna,&rsquo; Pipru, Namuchi, Rudhikr&aacute;, Varchin and his
hundred thousand descendants;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3339src" href=
"#xd26e3339" name="xd26e3339src">3</a> the deadly strangling serpent
Ahi, especial type of Drouth as it dries up rivers; and through all
these combats with the alleged authors of the recurring Barrenness and
Famine, as most of these monsters were, the seat of the evil was the
Sun-god&rsquo;s adorable self!</p>
<p>Almost pathetic does the long and vast history appear just now, when
competent men of science are giving us good reason to believe that
right knowledge of the sun, and the relation of its spots to the
rainfall, might have covered India with ways and means which would have
adapted the entire realm to its environment, and wrested from Indra his
hostile thunderbolt&mdash;the sunstroke of famine. The Hindus have
covered their lands with temples raised to propitiate and deprecate the
demons, and to invoke the deities against such sources of drouth and
famine. Had they concluded that famine was the result of inexactly
quartered sun-dials, the land would have been covered with perfect
sun-dials; but the famine would have been more destructive, because of
the increasing withdrawal of mind and energy from the true cause, and
its implied answer. Even so were conflagrations in London attributed to
inexact city clocks; the clocks would become perfect, the
conflagrations more numerous, through misdirection of vigilance. But
how much wiser are we of Christendom than the Hindus? <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>They
have adapted their country perfectly for propitiation of famine-demons
that do not exist, at a cost which would long ago have rendered them
secure from the famine-forces that do exist. We have similarly covered
Christendom with a complete system of securities against hells and
devils and wrathful deities that do not exist, while around our
churches, chapels, cathedrals, are the actually-existent seething hells
of pauperism, shame, and crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing can advance art in any district of this accursed
machine-and-devil-driven England until she changes her mind in many
things.&rsquo; So wrote John Ruskin recently. Of course, so long as the
machine toils and earns wealth and other power which still goes to
support and further social and ecclesiastical forms, constituted with
reference to salvation from a devil or demons no longer believed in,
the phrase &lsquo;machine-and-devil-driven&rsquo; is true. Until the
invention and enterprise of the nation are administered in the interest
of right ideas, we may still sigh, like John Sterling, for &lsquo;a
dozen men to stand up for ideas as Cobden and his friends do for
machinery.&rsquo; But it still remains as true that all the machinery
and wealth of England devoted to man might make its every home happy,
and educate every inhabitant, as that every idolatrous temple in India
might be commuted into a shield against famine.</p>
<p>Our astronomers and economists have enabled us to see clearly how
the case is with the country whose temples offer no obstruction to
christian vision. The facts point to the conclusion that the sun-spots
reach their maximum and minimum of intensity at intervals of eleven
years, and that their high activity is attended with frequent
fluctuations of the magnetic needle, and increased rainfall. In 1811,
and since then, famines in India have, with one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>exception, followed years of minimum
sun-spots.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3352src" href="#xd26e3352" name=
"xd26e3352src">4</a> These facts are sufficiently well attested to
warrant the belief that English science and skill will be able to
realise in India the provision which Joseph is said to have made for
the seven lean years of which Pharaoh dreamed.</p>
<p>Until that happy era shall arrive, the poor Hindus will only go on
alternately adoring and propitiating the sun, as its benign or its
cruel influences shall fall upon them. The artist Turner said,
&lsquo;The sun is God.&rsquo; The superb effects of light in
Turner&rsquo;s pictures could hardly have come from any but a
sun-worshipper dwelling amid fogs. Unfamiliarity often breeds
reverence. There are few countries in which the sun, when it does
shine, is so likely to be greeted with enthusiasm, and observed in all
its variations of splendour, as one in which its appearance is rare.
Yet the superstition inherited from regions where the sun is equally a
desolation was strong enough to blot out its glory in the mind of a
writer famous in his time, Tobias Swinden, M.A., who wrote a work to
prove the sun to be the abode of the damned.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3357src" href="#xd26e3357" name="xd26e3357src">5</a> The
speculation may now appear only curious, but, probably, it is no more
curious than a hundred years from now will seem to all the vulgar
notion of future fiery torments for mankind, the scriptural necessity
of which led the fanciful rector to his grotesque conclusion. These two
extremes&mdash;the Sun-worship of Turner, the Sun-horror of
Swinden,&mdash;survivals in England, represent the two antagonistic
aspects of the sun, which were of overwhelming import to those who
dwelt beneath its greatest potency. His ill-humour, or his hunger and
thirst, in any year transformed the earth to a desert, and dealt death
to thousands.</p>
<p>In countries where drouth, barrenness, and consequent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>famine were occasional, as in India, it would be
an inevitable result that they would represent the varying moods of a
powerful will, and in such regions we naturally find the most extensive
appliances for propitiation. The preponderant number of fat years would
tell powerfully on the popular imagination in favour of priestly
intercession, and the advantage of sacrifices to the great Hunger-demon
who sometimes consumed the seeds of the earth. But in countries where
barrenness was an ever-present, visible, unvarying fact, the Demon of
the Desert would represent Necessity, a power not to be coaxed or
changed. People dwelling in distant lands might invent theoretical
myths to account for the desert. It might be an accident resulting from
the Sun-god having given up his chariot one day to an inexperienced
driver who came too close to the earth. But to those who lived beside
the desert it could only seem an infernal realm, quite irrecoverable.
The ancient civilisation of Egypt, so full of grandeur, might, in good
part, have been due to the lesson taught them by the desert, that they
could not change the conditions around them by any entreaties, but must
make the best of what was left. If such, indeed, was the force that
built the ancient civilisation whose monuments remain so magnificent in
their ruins, its decay might be equally accounted for when that
primitive faith passed into a theological phase. For as Necessity is
the mother of invention, Fate is fatal to the same. Belief in facts,
and laws fixed in the organic nature of things, stimulates man to study
them and constitute his life with reference to them; but belief that
things are fixed by the arbitrary decree of an individual power is the
final sentence of enterprise. Fate might thus steadily bring to ruin
the grandest achievements of Necessity.</p>
<p>Had we only the true history of the Sphinx&mdash;the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>Binder&mdash;we might find it a landmark between
the rise and decline of Egyptian civilisation. When the great
Limitation surrounding the powers of man was first personified with
that mystical grandeur, it would stand in the desert not as the riddle
but its solution. No such monument was ever raised by Doubt. But once
personified and outwardly shaped, the external Binder must bind thought
as well; nay, will throttle thought if it cannot pierce through the
stone and discover the meaning of it. &lsquo;How true is that old fable
of the Sphinx who sat by the wayside propounding her riddle to the
passengers, which if they could not answer she destroyed them! Such a
Sphinx is this Life of ours to all men and societies of men. Nature,
like the Sphinx, is of womanly celestial loveliness and tenderness; the
face and bosom of a goddess, but ending in claws and the body of a
lioness. There is in her a celestial beauty,&mdash;which means
celestial order, pliancy to wisdom; but there is also a darkness, a
ferocity, fatality, which are infernal. She is a goddess, but one not
yet disimprisoned; one still half-imprisoned,&mdash;the articulate,
lovely still encased in the inarticulate, chaotic. How true! And does
she not propound her riddles to us? Of each man she asks daily, in mild
voice, yet with a terrible significance, &lsquo;Knowest thou the
meaning of this Day? What thou canst do To-day, wisely attempt to
do.&rsquo; Nature, Universe, Destiny, Existence, howsoever we name this
grand unnameable Fact, in the midst of which we live and struggle, is
as a heavenly bride and conquest to the wise and brave, to them who can
discern her behests and do them; a destroying fiend to them who cannot.
Answer her riddle, it is well with thee. Answer it not, pass on
regarding it not, it will answer itself; the solution for thee is a
thing of teeth and claws; Nature to thee is a dumb lioness, deaf to thy
pleadings, fiercely devouring. Thou art not now her victorious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>bridegroom; thou art her mangled victim,
scattered on the precipices, as a slave found treacherous, recreant,
ought to be, and must.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3370src" href=
"#xd26e3370" name="xd26e3370src">6</a></p>
<p>On the verge of the Desert, Prime Minister to the Necropolis at
whose gateway it stands, the Sphinx reposes amid the silence of science
and the centuries. Who built it? None can answer, so far as the human
artist, or the king under whom he worked, is concerned. But the ideas
and natural forces which built the Sphinx surround even now the
arch&aelig;ologist who tries to discover its history and chronology. As
fittest appendage to Carlyle&rsquo;s interpretation, let us read some
passages from Lepsius.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Oedipus for this king of the Sphinxes is yet wanting.
Whoever would drain the immeasurable sand-flood which buries the tombs
themselves, and lay open the base of the Sphinx, the ancient
temple-path, and the surrounding hills, could easily decide it. But
with the enigmas of history there are joined many riddles and wonders
of nature, which I must not leave quite unnoticed. The newest of all,
at least, I must describe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had descended with Abeken into a mummy-pit, to open some
newly discovered sarcophagi, and was not a little astonished, upon
descending, to find myself in a regular snow-drift of locusts, which,
almost darkening the heavens, flew over our heads from the south-west
from the desert in hundreds of thousands to the valley. I took it for a
single flight, and called my companions from the tombs, where they were
busy, that they might see this Egyptian wonder ere it was over. But the
flight continued; indeed the work-people said it had begun an hour
before. Then we first observed that the whole region, near and far, was
covered with locusts. I sent an attendant into the desert to discover
the breadth of the flock. He ran <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177"
href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>for the distance of a quarter
of an hour, then returned and told us that, as far as he could see,
there was no end to them. I rode home in the midst of the locust
shower. At the edge of the fruitful plain they fell down in showers;
and so it went on the whole day until the evening, and so the next day
from morning till evening, and the third; in short to the sixth day,
indeed in weaker flights much longer. Yesterday it did seem that a
storm of rain in the desert had knocked down and destroyed the last of
them. The Arabs are now lighting great smoke-fires in the fields, and
clattering and making loud noises all day long to preserve their crops
from the unexpected invasion. It will, however, do little good. Like a
new animated vegetation, these millions of winged spoilers cover even
the neighbouring sand-hills, so that scarcely anything is to be seen of
the ground; and when they rise from one place they immediately fall
down somewhere in the neighbourhood; they are tired with their long
journey, and seem to have lost all fear of their natural enemies, men,
animals, smoke, and noise, in their furious wish to fill their
stomachs, and in the feeding of their immense number. The most
wonderful thing, in my estimation, is their flight over the naked
wilderness, and the instinct which has guided them from some oasis over
the inhospitable desert to the fat soil of the Nile vale. Fourteen
years ago, it seems, this Egyptian plague last visited Egypt with the
same force. The popular idea is that they are sent by the comet which
we have observed for twelve days in the South-west, and which, as it is
now no longer obscured by the rays of the moon, stretches forth its
stately tail across the heavens in the hours of the night. The Zodiacal
light, too, so seldom seen in the north, has lately been visible for
several nights in succession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other plagues of Egypt are described by Lepsius:&mdash; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Suddenly the storm grew to a tremendous hurricane, such as I
have never seen in Europe, and hail fell upon us in such masses as
almost to turn day into night&#8202;&hellip;. Our tents lie in a
valley, whither the plateau of the pyramids inclines, and are sheltered
from the worst winds from the north and west. Presently I saw a dashing
mountain flood hurrying down upon our prostrate and sand-covered tents,
like a giant serpent upon its certain prey. The principal stream rolled
on to the great tent; another arm threatened mine without reaching it.
But everything that had been washed from our tents by the shower was
torn away by the two streams, which joined behind the tents, and
carried into a pool behind the Sphinx, where a great lake immediately
formed, which fortunately had no outlet. Just picture this scene to
yourself! Our tents, dashed down by the storm and heavy rain, lying
between two mountain torrents, thrusting themselves in several places
to the depth of six feet in the sand, and depositing our books,
drawings, sketches, shirts, and instruments&mdash;yes, even our levers
and iron crow-bars; in short, everything they could seize, in the dark
foaming mud-ocean. Besides this, ourselves wet to the skin, without
hats, fastening up the weightier things, rushing after the lighter
ones, wading into the lake to the waist to fish out what the sand had
not yet swallowed; and all this was the work of a quarter of an hour,
at the end of which the sun shone radiantly again, and announced the
end of this flood by a bright and glorious rainbow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now comes the plague of mice, with which we were not formerly
acquainted; in my tent they grow, play, and whistle, as if they had
been at home here all their lives, and quite regardless of my presence.
At night they have already run across my bed and face, and yesterday I
started terrified from my slumbers, as I suddenly felt the sharp tooth
of such a daring guest at my foot. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179"
href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Above me a canopy of gauze is spread, in order to keep off
the flies, these most shameless of the plagues of Egypt, during the
day, and the mosquitos at night&#8202;&hellip;. Scorpions and serpents
have not bitten us yet, but there are very malicious wasps, which have
often stung us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The dale (in the Desert) was wild and monotonous, nothing but
sandstone rock, the surfaces of which were burned as black as coals,
but turned into burning golden yellow at every crack, and every ravine,
whence a number of sand-rivulets, like fire-streams from black dross,
ran and filled the valleys. No tree, no tuft of grass had we yet seen,
also no animals, except a few vultures and crows feeding on the carcase
of the latest fallen camel&#8202;&hellip;. Over a wild and broken path,
and cutting stones, we came deeper and deeper into the gorge. The first
wide basins were empty, we therefore left the camels and donkeys
behind, climbed up the smooth granite wall, and thus proceeded amidst
these grand rocks from one basin to another; they were all empty.
Behind there, in the farthest ravine, the guide said there must be
water, for it was never empty; but there proved to be not a single
drop. We were obliged to return dry&#8202;&hellip;. We saw the most
beautiful <i>mirages</i> very early in the day; they most minutely
resemble seas and lakes, in which mountains, rocks, and everything in
their vicinity, are reflected as in the clearest water. They form a
remarkable contrast with the staring dry desert, and have probably
deceived many a poor wanderer, as the legend goes. If one be not aware
that no water is there, it is quite impossible to distinguish the
appearance from the reality. A few days ago I felt quite sure that I
perceived an overflowing of the Nile, or a branch near El
Mech&ecirc;ref, and rode towards it, but only found Bahr Sheitan,
Satan&rsquo;s water, as the Arabs call it.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3397src" href="#xd26e3397" name="xd26e3397src">7</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>Amid such scenery the Sphinx arose. Egypt was able to recognise the
problem of blended barrenness and beauty&mdash;alternation of
Nature&rsquo;s flowing breast and leonine claw&mdash;but could she
return the right answer? The primitive Egyptian answer may, indeed, as
I have guessed, be the great monuments of her civilisation, but her
historic solution has been another world. This world a desert, with
here and there a momentary oasis, where man may dance and feast a
little, stimulated by the corpse borne round the banquet, ere he passes
to paradise. So thought they and were deceived; from generation to
generation have they been destroyed, even unto this day. How destroyed,
Lepsius may again be our witness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The She&icirc;kh of the Saad&icirc;ch-derwishes rides to the
chief She&icirc;kh of all the derwishes of Egypt, El Bekri. On the way
thither, a great number of these holy folk, and others, too, who fancy
themselves not a whit behind-hand in piety, throw themselves flat on
the ground, with their faces downward, and so that the feet of one lie
close to the head of the next; over this living carpet the she&icirc;kh
rides on his horse, which is led on each side by an attendant, in order
to compel the animal to the unnatural march. Each body receives two
treads of the horse; most of them jump up again without hurt, but
whoever suffers serious, or as it occasionally happens, mortal injury,
has the additional ignominy to bear of not having pronounced, or not
being able to pronounce, the proper prayers and magical charms that
alone could save him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a fearful barbarous worship&rsquo; (the Sikr, in which
the derwishes dance until exhausted, howling &lsquo;No God but
Allah&rsquo;) &lsquo;which the astounded multitude, great and small,
gentle and simple, gaze upon seriously, and with stupid respect, and in
which it not unfrequently takes a part! The invoked deity is manifestly
much less an object of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href=
"#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>reverence than the fanatic saints
who invoke him; for mad, idiotic, or other psychologically-diseased
persons are very generally looked upon as holy by the Mohammedans, and
treated with great respect. It is the demoniacal,
incomprehensibly-acting, and therefore fearfully-observed, power of
nature that the natural man always reveres when he perceives it,
because he is sensible of some connection between it and his
intellectual power, without being able to command it; first in the
mighty elements, then in the wondrous but obscure law-governed
instincts of animals, and at last in the yet more overpowering
ecstatical or generally abnormal mental condition of his own
race.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The right answer to the enigma of the Sphinx is Man. But this
creature prostrating himself under the She&icirc;kh&rsquo;s horse, or
under the invisible She&icirc;kh called Allah, and ascribing sanctity
to the half-witted, is not Man at all. Those hard-worked slaves who
escaped into the wilderness, and set up for worship an anthropomorphic
Supreme Will, and sought their promised milk and honey in this world
alone, carried with them the only force that could rightly answer the
Sphinx. <i>Their</i> Allah or Elohim they heard say,&mdash;&lsquo;Why
howlest thou to me? Go forward.&rsquo; Somewhat more significant than
his usual jests was that cartoon of <i>Punch</i> which represented the
Sphinx with relaxed face smiling recognition on the most eminent of
contemporary Israelites returning to the land of his race&rsquo;s
ancient bondage, to buy the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal half answers the
Sphinx; when man has subdued the Great Desert to a sea, the solution
will be complete, and the Sphinx may cast herself into it.</p>
<p>Far and wide through the Southern world have swarmed the locusts
described by Lepsius, and with them have migrated many superstitions.
The writer of this well remembers the visit of the so-called
&lsquo;Seventeen-year locusts,&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>to the region of
Virginia where he was born, and across many years can hear the terrible
never-ceasing roar coming up from the woods, uttering, as all agreed,
the ominous word &lsquo;Pharaoh.&rsquo; On each wing every eye could
see the letter W, signifying War. With that modern bit of ancient Egypt
in my memory, I find the old Locust-mythology sufficiently
impressive.</p>
<p>By an old tradition the Egyptians, as described by Lepsius,
connected the locusts with the comet. In the Apocalypse (ix.) a falling
star is the token of the descent of the Locust-demon to unlock the pit
that his swarms may issue forth for their work of destruction. Their
king Abaddon, in Greek Apollyon,&mdash;Destroyer,&mdash;has had an
evolution from being the angel of the two (rabbinical) divisions of
Hades to the successive Chiefs of Saracenic hordes. It is interesting
to compare the graphic description of a locust-storm in Joel, with its
adaptation to an army of human destroyers in the Apocalypse. And again
the curious description of these hosts of Abaddon in the latter book,
partly repeat the strange notions of the Bedouins concerning the
locust,&mdash;one of whom, says Niebuhr, &lsquo;compared the head of
the locust to that of the horse; its breast to that of a lion; its feet
to those of a camel; its body to that of the serpent; its tail to that
of the scorpion; its horns (antenn&aelig;) to the locks of hair of a
virgin.&rsquo; The present generation has little reason to deny the
appropriateness of the biblical descriptions of Scythian hordes as
locusts. &lsquo;The land is as the garden of Eden before them, and
behind them a desolate wilderness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ancient seeming contest between apparent Good and Evil in Egypt,
was represented in the wars of Ra and Set. It is said (Gen. iv. 26),
&lsquo;And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name
Enos; then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.&rsquo; Aquila
reads <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>this&mdash;&lsquo;Then Seth began to be called
by the name of the Lord.&rsquo; Mr. Baring-Gould remarks on this that
Seth was at first regarded by the Egyptians as the deity of light and
civilisation, but that they afterwards identified as Typhon, because he
was the chief god of the Hyksos or shepherd kings; and in their hatred
of these oppressors the name of Seth was everywhere obliterated from
their monuments, and he was represented as an ass, or with an
ass&rsquo;s head.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3428src" href="#xd26e3428"
name="xd26e3428src">8</a> But the earliest date assigned to the Hyksos
dominion in Egypt, <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 2000, coincides with
that of the Egyptian planisphere in Kircher,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3434src" href="#xd26e3434" name="xd26e3434src">9</a> where Seth
is found identified with Sirius, or the dog-headed Mercury, in
Capricorn. This is the Sothiac Period, or Cycle of the Dog-star. He was
thus associated with the goat and the winter solstice, to which
(<span class="sc">B.C.</span> 2000) Capricorn was adjacent. That Seth
or Set became the name for the demon of disorder and violence among the
Egyptians is, indeed, probably due to his being a chief god, among some
tribes Baal himself, among the Asiatics, before the time of the Hyksos.
It was already an old story to put their neighbours&rsquo; Light for
their own Darkness. The Ass&rsquo;s ears they gave him referred not to
his stupidity, but to his hearing everything, as in the case of the Ass
of Apuleius, and the ass Nicon of Plutarch, or, indeed, the many
examples of the same kind which preceeded the appearance of this much
misunderstood animal as the steed of Christ&rsquo;s triumphal entry
into Jerusalem. In Egyptian symbolism those long ears were as much
dreaded as devils&rsquo; horns. From the eyes of Ra all beneficent
things, from the eyes of Set all noxious things, were produced.
Amen-Ra, as the former was called, slew the son of Set, the great
serpent Naka, which in one hymn is perhaps tauntingly said to have
&lsquo;saved his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184"
name="pb184">184</a>]</span><i>feet</i>.&rsquo; Amen-Ra becomes Horus
and Set becomes Typhon. The Typhonian myth is very complex, and
includes the conflict between the Nile and all its enemies&mdash;the
crocodiles that lurk in it, the sea that swallows it, the drouth that
dries it, the burning heat that brings malaria from it, the floods that
render it destructive&mdash;and Set was through it evolved to a point
where he became identified with Saturn, Sheitan, or Satan. Plutarch,
identifying Set with Typho, says that those powers of the universal
Soul, which are subject to the influences of passions, and in the
material system whatever is noxious, as bad air, irregular seasons,
eclipses of the sun and moon, are ascribed to Typho. The name Set,
according to him, means &lsquo;violent&rsquo; and
&lsquo;hostile;&rsquo; and he was described as
&lsquo;double-headed,&rsquo; &lsquo;he who has two countenances,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;the Lord of the World.&rsquo; Not the least significant
fact, in a moral sense, is that Set or Typho is represented as the
brother of Osiris whom he slew.</p>
<p>Without here going into the question of relationship between Typhaon
and Typhoeus, we may feel tolerably certain that the fire-breathing
hurricane-monster Typhaon of Homer, and the hundred-headed, fierce-eyed
roarer Typhoeus&mdash;son of Tartarus, father of Winds and
Harpies&mdash;represent the same ferocities of Nature. No fitter place
was ever assigned him than the African desert, and the story of the
gods and goddesses fleeing before Typhon into Egypt, and there
transforming themselves into animals, from terror, is a transparent
tribute to the dominion over the wilderness of sand exercised by the
typhoon in its many moods. The vulture-harpy tearing the dead is his
child. He is many-headed; now hot, stifling, tainted; now tempestuous;
here sciroc, there hurricane, and often tornado. It may be indeed that
as at once coiled in the whirlwind and blistering, he is the fiery
serpent to appease <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185"
name="pb185">185</a>]</span>whom Moses lifted the brasen serpent for
the worship of Israel. I have often seen snakes hung up by negroes in
Virginia, to bring rain in time of drouth. Typhon, as may easily be
seen by the accompanying figure (<a href="#fig14">14</a>), is a hungry
and thirsty demon. His tongue is lolling out with thirst.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3452src" href="#xd26e3452" name=
"xd26e3452src">10</a> His later connection with the underworld is shown
in various myths, one of which seems to suggest a popular belief that
Typhon is not pleased with the mummies withheld from him, and that he
can enjoy his human viands only through burials of the dead. In Egypt,
after the Coptic Easter Monday&mdash;called Shemmen-Nesseem (smelling
the zephyr)&mdash;come the fifty-days&rsquo; hot wind, called Khamseen
or Cain wind. After slaying Abel, Cain wandered amid such a wind,
tortured with fever and thirst. Then he saw two birds fight in the air;
one having killed the other scratched a hole in the desert sand and
buried it. Cain then did the like by his brother&rsquo;s body, when a
zephyr sprang up and cooled his fever. But still, say the Alexandrians,
the fifty-days&rsquo; hot Cain wind return annually.</p>

<p>In pictures of the mirage, or in cloud-shapes faintly illumined by
the afterglow, the dwellers beside the plains of sand saw, as in
phantasmagoria, the gorgeous palaces, the air-castles, and mysterious
cities, which make the romance of the desert. Unwilling to believe that
such realms of barrenness had ever been created by any good
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>god, they beheld in dreams, which answer to
nature&rsquo;s own mirage-dreaming, visions of dynasties passed away,
of magnificent palaces and monarchs on whose pomp and heaven-defying
pride the fatal sand-storm had fallen, and buried their glories in the
dust for ever. The desert became the emblem of immeasurable
all-devouring Time. In many of these legends there are intimations of a
belief that Eden itself lay where now all is unbroken desert. In the
beautiful legend in the Midrash of Solomon&rsquo;s voyage on the Wind,
the monarch alighted near a lofty palace of gold, &lsquo;and the scent
there was like the scent of the garden of Eden.&rsquo; The dust had so
surrounded this palace that Solomon and his companions only learned
that there had been an entrance from an eagle in it thirteen centuries
old, which had heard from its father the tradition of an entrance on
the western side. The obedient Wind having cleared away the sand, a
door was found on whose lock was written, &lsquo;Be it known to you, ye
sons of men, that we dwelt in this palace in prosperity and delight
many years. When the famine came upon us we ground pearls in the mill
instead of wheat, but it profited us nothing.&rsquo; Amid marvellous
splendours, from chamber to chamber garnished with ruby, topaz,
emerald, Solomon passed to a mansion on whose three gates were written
admonitions of the transitory nature of all things but&mdash;Death.
&lsquo;Let not fortune deceive thee.&rsquo; &lsquo;The world is given
from one to another.&rsquo; On the third gate was written, &lsquo;Take
provision for thy journey, and make ready food for thyself while it is
yet day; for thou shalt not be left on the earth, and thou knowest not
the day of thy Death.&rsquo; This gate Solomon opened and saw within a
life-like image seated: as the monarch approached, this image cried
with a loud voice, &lsquo;Come hither, ye children of Satan; see! King
Solomon is come to destroy you.&rsquo; Then fire <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>and
smoke issued from the nostrils of the image; and there were loud and
bitter cries, with earthquake and thunder. But Solomon uttered against
them the Ineffable Name, and all the images fell on their faces, and
the sons of Satan fled and cast themselves into the sea, that they
might not fall into the hands of Solomon. The king then took from the
neck of the image a silver tablet, with an inscription which he could
not read, until the Almighty sent a youth to assist him. It
said:&mdash;&lsquo;I, Sheddad, son of Ad, reigned over a thousand
thousand provinces, and rode on a thousand thousand horses; a thousand
thousand kings were subject to me, and a thousand thousand warriors I
slew<span class="corr" id="xd26e3472" title="Not in source">.</span>
Yet in the hour that the Angel of Death came against me, I could not
withstand him. Whoso shall read this writing let him not trouble
himself greatly about this world, for the end of all men is to die, and
nothing remains to man but a good name.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3475src" href="#xd26e3475" name="xd26e3475src">11</a></p>
<p>Azazel&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="corr" id="xd26e3480" title=
"Source: strong against God">of doubtful meaning</span>&rsquo;&mdash;is
the biblical name of the Demon of the Desert (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=lev%2016&amp;version=NRSV">Lev.
xvi</a>.). &lsquo;Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for
Jehovah, and the other for Azazel. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon
which the lot for Jehovah fell, and offer him for a sin-offering: But
the goat, on which the lot for Azazel fell, shall be presented alive
before Jehovah, to make an atonement with him, to let him go to Azazel
in the wilderness&#8202;&hellip;. And Aaron shall lay both his hands
upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities
of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their
sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and send him away by the
hand of a fit man into the desert. And the goat shall bear upon him all
their iniquities unto <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href=
"#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>a land not inhabited; and he shall
let go the goat in the desert.&rsquo; Of the moral elements here
involved much will have to be said hereafter. This demon ultimately
turned to a devil; and persisting through both forms is the familiar
principle that it is &lsquo;well enough to have friends on both
sides&rsquo; so plainly at work in the levitical custom; but it is
particularly interesting to observe that the same animal should be used
as offerings to the antagonistic deities. In Egyptian Mythology we find
that the goat had precisely this two-fold consecration. It was sacred
to Chem, the Egyptian Pan, god of orchards and of all fruitful lands;
and it became also sacred to Mendes, the &lsquo;Destroyer,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Avenging Power&rsquo; of Ra. It will thus be seen that the same
principle which from the sun detached the fructifying from the
desert-making power, and made Typhon and Osiris hostile brothers,
prevailed to send the same animal to Azazel in the Desert and Jehovah
of the milk and honey land. Originally the goat was supreme. The
Samaritan Pentateuch<span class="corr" id="xd26e3488" title=
"Not in source">, according to Aben Ezra (Preface to Esther),</span>
opens, &lsquo;In the beginning <span class="corr" id="xd26e3491" title=
"Source: the Goat">Ashima</span> created the heaven and the
earth.&rsquo; In the Hebrew culture-myth of Cain and Abel, also
brothers, there may be represented, as Goldziher supposes, the victory
of the agriculturist over the nomad or shepherd; but there is also
traceable in it the supremacy of the Goat, Mendez or Azima. &lsquo;Abel
brought the firstling of the goats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Very striking is the American (Iroquois) myth of the conflict
between Joskeha and Tawiscara,&mdash;the White One and the Dark One.
They were twins, born of a virgin who died in giving them life. Their
grandmother was the moon (Ataensic, <i>she who bathes</i>). These
brothers fought, Joskeha using as weapon the horns of a stag, Tawiscara
the wild-rose. The latter fled sorely wounded, and the blood gushing
from him turned to flint-stones. The victor, who used the stag-horns
(the same weapon that Frey uses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"
href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>against Beli, in the Prose
Edda, and denoting perhaps a primitive bone-age art), destroyed a
monster frog which swallowed all the waters, and guided the torrents
into smooth streams and lakes. He stocked the woods with game, invented
fire, watched and watered crops, and without him, says the old
missionary Brebeuf, &lsquo;they think they could not boil a pot.&rsquo;
The use by the desert-demon Tawiscara of a wild rose as his weapon is a
beautiful touch in this myth. So much loveliness grew even amid the
hard flints. One is reminded of the closing scene in the second part of
Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>. There, when Faust has realised the perfect
hour to which he can say, &lsquo;Stay, thou art fair!&rsquo; by causing
by his labour a wilderness to blossom as a rose, he lies down in happy
death; and when the demons come for his soul, angels pelt them with
roses, which sting them like flames. Not wild roses were these, such as
gave the Dark One such poor succour. The defence of Faust is the roses
he has evoked from briars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href=

<p class="first">Related to the demons of Barrenness, and to the
hostile human demons, but still possessing characteristics of their
own, are the demons supposed to haunt gorges, mountain ranges, ridges
of rocks, streams which cannot be forded and are yet unbridged, rocks
that wreck the raft or boat. Each and every obstruction that stood in
the way of man&rsquo;s plough, or of his first frail ship, or his
migration, has been assigned its demon. The reader of Goethe&rsquo;s
page has only to turn to the opening lines of Walpurgisnacht in
<i>Faust</i> to behold the real pandemonium of the Northern man, as in
Milton he may find that of the dweller amid fiery deserts and
volcanoes. That labyrinth of vales, crossed with wild crag and furious
torrent, is the natural scenery to surround the orgies of the phantoms
which flit from the uncultured brain to uncultured nature. Elsewhere in
Goethe&rsquo;s great poem, Mephistopheles pits against the philosophers
the popular theory of the rugged remnants of chaos in nature, and the
obstacles before which man is powerless. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">Ruskin has the same gloomy report to make of the
mountaineers of Europe. &lsquo;The wild goats that leap along those
rocks have as much passion of joy in all that fair work of God as the
men that toil among them. Perhaps more.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is it not strange
to reflect that hardly an evening passes in London or Paris but one of
those cottages is painted for the better amusement of the fair and
idle, and shaded with pasteboard pines by the scene-shifter; and that
good and kind people,&mdash;poetically minded,&mdash;delight themselves
in imagining the happy life led by peasants who dwell by Alpine
fountains, and kneel to crosses upon peaks of rock? that nightly we lay
down our gold to fashion forth simulacra of peasants, in gay ribbons
and white bodices, singing sweet songs and bowing gracefully to the
picturesque crosses; and all the while the veritable peasants are
kneeling, songlessly, to veritable crosses in another temper than the
kind and fair audiences dream of, and assuredly with another kind of
answer than is got out of the opera catastrophe.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3629src" href="#xd26e3629" name=
"xd26e3629src">3</a></p>
<p>The writer remembers well the emphasis with which a poor woman at
whose cottage he asked the path to the Natural Bridge in Virginia said,
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know why so many people come to these rocks; for
my part, give me a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193"
name="pb193">193</a>]</span>level country.&rsquo; Many ages lay between
that aged crone and Emerson or Ruskin, and they were ages of heavy war
with the fortresses of nature. The fabled ordeals of water and fire
through which the human race passed were associated with Ararat and
Sinai, because to migrating or farming man the mountain was always an
ordeal, irrespective even of its torrents or its occasional
lava-streams. A terrible vista is opened by the cry of Lot, &lsquo;I
cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me!&rsquo; Not even
the fire consuming Sodom in the plains could nerve him to dare cope
with the demons of the steep places. As time went on, devotees proved
to the awe-stricken peasantries their sanctity and authority by
combating those mountain demons, and erecting their altars in the
&lsquo;high places.&rsquo; So many summits became sacred. But this very
sanctity was the means of bringing on successive demoniac hordes to
haunt them; for every new religion saw in those altars in &lsquo;high
places&rsquo; not victories over demons, but demon-shrines. And thus
mountains became the very battlefields between rival deities, each
demon to his or her rival; and the conflict lasts from the cursing of
the &lsquo;high places&rsquo; by the priests of Israel<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3636src" href="#xd26e3636" name="xd26e3636src">4</a>
to the Devil&rsquo;s Pulpits of the Alps and Apennines. Among the
beautiful frescoes at Baden is that of the Angel&rsquo;s and the
Devil&rsquo;s Pulpit, by G&ouml;tzenberger. Near Gernsbach,
appropriately at the point where the cultivable valley meets the
unconquerable crests of rock, stand the two pulpits from which Satan
and an Angel contended, when the first Christian missionaries had
failed to convert the rude foresters. When, by the Angel&rsquo;s
eloquence, all were won from the Devil&rsquo;s side except a few
witches and usurers, the fiend tore up great masses of rock and built
the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Mill&rsquo; on the mountain-top; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>and
he was hurled down by the Almighty on the rocks near
&lsquo;Lord&rsquo;s Meadow,&rsquo; where the marks of his claws may
still be seen, and where, by a diminishing number of undiminished ears,
his groans are still heard when a storm rages through the valley.</p>
<p>Such conflicts as these have been in some degree associated with
every mountain of holy or unholy fame. Each was in its time a prosaic
Hill Difficulty, with lions by no means chained, to affright the hearts
of Mistrust and Timorous, till Dervish or Christian impressed there his
holy footprint, visible from Adam&rsquo;s Peak to Olivet, or built
there his convents, discernible from Meru and Olympus to Pontyprydd and
St. Catharine&rsquo;s Hill. By necessary truces the demons and deities
repair gradually to their respective summits,&mdash;Seir and Sinai hold
each their own. But the Holy Hills have never equalled the number of
Dark Mountains<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3644src" href="#xd26e3644"
name="xd26e3644src">5</a> dreaded by man. These obstructive demons made
the mountains Moul-ge and Nin-ge, names for the King and Queen of the
Accadian Hell; they made the Finnish Mount Kippumaki the abode of all
Pests. They have identified their name (Elf) with the Alps, given
nearly every tarn an evil fame, and indeed created a special class of
demons, &lsquo;Montagnards,&rsquo; much dreaded by medi&aelig;val
miners, whose faces they sometimes twisted so that they must look
backward physically, as they were much in the habit of doing mentally,
for ever afterward. Gervais of Tilbury, in his Chronicle, declares that
on the top of Mount Canigon in France, which has a very inaccessible
summit, there is a black lake of unknown depth, at whose bottom the
demons have a palace, and that if any one drops a stone into that
water, the wrath of the mountain demons is shown in sudden and
frightful tempests. From a like tarn in Cornwall, as Cornish Folklore
claims, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>on an accessible but very tedious hill, came up
the hand which received the brand Escalibore when its master could
wield it no more,&mdash;as told in the Morte D&rsquo;Arthur, with,
however, clear reference to the sea.</p>
<p>I cannot forbear enlivening my page with the following sketch of a
visit of English officers to the realm of Ten-jo, the long-nosed
Mountain-demon of Japan, which is very suggestive of the mental
atmosphere amid which such spectres exist. The mountains and forests of
Japan are, say these writers, inhabited as thickly by good and evil
spirits as the Hartz and Black Forest, and chief among them, in
horrible sanctity, is O-yama,&mdash;the word echoes the Hindu Yama,
Japanese Amma, kings of Hades,&mdash;whose demon is Ten-jo. Abdul and
Mulney once started, on three days&rsquo; leave, with the intention of
climbing to the summit&mdash;not of Ten-jo&rsquo;s nose, but of the
mountain; their principal reason for so doing being simply that they
were told by every one that they had better not. They first tried the
ascent on the most accessible side, but fierce two-sworded yakomins
jealously guarded it; and they were obliged to make the attempt on the
other, which was almost inaccessible, and was Ten-jo&rsquo;s region.
The villagers at the base of the mountain begged them to give up the
project; and one old man, a species of patriarch, reasoned with them.
&lsquo;What are you going to do when you get to the top?&rsquo; he
asked. Our two friends were forced to admit that their course, then,
would be very similar to that of the king of France and his
men&mdash;come down again.</p>
<p>The old man laughed pityingly, and said, &lsquo;Well, go if you
like; but, take my word for it, Ten-jo will do you an
injury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They asked who Ten-jo was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why Ten-jo,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;is an evil
spirit, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>a long nose, who will dislocate your limbs if
you persist in going up the mountain on this side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you know he has got a long nose?&rsquo; they asked,
&lsquo;Have you ever seen him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because all evil spirits have long noses&rsquo;&mdash;here
Mulney hung his head,&mdash;&lsquo;and,&rsquo; continued the old man,
not noticing how dreadfully personal he was becoming to one of the
party, &lsquo;Ten-jo has the longest of the lot. Did you ever know a
man with a long nose who was good?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Mulney hurriedly to Abdul, &lsquo;or the
old fool will make me out an evil spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Syonara,&rsquo; said the old man as they walked away,
&lsquo;but look out for Ten-jo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After climbing hard for some hours, and not meeting a single human
being,&mdash;not even the wood-cutter could be tempted by the fine
timber to encroach on Ten-jo&rsquo;s precincts,&mdash;they reached the
top, and enjoyed a magnificent view. After a rest they started on their
descent, the worst part of which they had accomplished, when, as they
were walking quietly along a good path, Abdul&rsquo;s ankle turned
under him, and he went down as if he had been shot, with his leg broken
in two places. With difficulty Mulney managed to get him to the village
they had started from, and the news ran like wild-fire that Ten-jo had
broken the leg of one of the adventurous tojins.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you how it would be,&rsquo; exclaimed the old man,
&lsquo;but you would go. Ah, Ten-jo is a dreadful fellow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>All the villagers, clustering round, took up the cry, and shook
their heads. Ten-jo&rsquo;s reputation had increased wonderfully by
this accident. Poor Abdul was on his back for eleven weeks, and numbers
of Japanese&mdash;for he was a general favourite amongst
them&mdash;went to see him, and to express their regret and horror at
Ten-jo&rsquo;s behaviour.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3676src" href=
"#xd26e3676" name="xd26e3676src">6</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>It is obvious that to a demon dwelling in a high mountain a long
nose would be variously useful to poke into the affairs of people
dwelling in the plains, and also to enjoy the scent of their sacrifices
offered at a respectful distance. That feature of the face which
Napoleon I. regarded as of martial importance, and which is prominent
in the warriors marked on the Mycen&aelig; pottery, has generally been
a physiognomical characteristic of European ogres, who are
blood-smellers. That the significance of Ten-jo&rsquo;s long nose is
this, appears probable when we compare him with the Calmuck demon
Erlik, whose long nose is for smelling out the dying. The Cossacks
believed that the protector of the earth was a many-headed elephant.
The snouted demon (<a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>) is from a picture of
Christ delivering Adam and Eve from hell, by Lucas Van Leyden,
1521.</p>

<p>The Chinese Mountains also have their demons. The demon of the
mountain T&rsquo;ai-shan, in Shantung, is believed to regulate the
punishments of men in this world and the next. Four other demon princes
rule over the principal mountain chains of the Empire. Mr. Dennys
remarks that mountainous localities are so regularly the homes of
fairies in Chinese superstition that some connection between the fact
and the relation of &lsquo;Elf&rsquo; to &lsquo;Alp&rsquo; in Europe
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>is suggested.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3696src" href="#xd26e3696" name="xd26e3696src">7</a> But this
coincidence is by no means so remarkable as the appearance among these
Chinese mountain sprites of the magical &lsquo;Sesame,&rsquo; so
familiar to us in Arabian legend. The celebrated mountain Ku&rsquo;en
Lun (usually identified with the Hindoo Kush) is said to be peopled
with fairies, who cultivate upon its terraces the &lsquo;fields of
sesamum and gardens of coriander seeds,&rsquo; which are eaten as
ordinary food by those who possess the gift of longevity.</p>
<p>In the superstitions of the American Aborigines we find gigantic
demons who with their hands piled up mountain-chains as their castles,
from whose peak-towers they hurled stones on their enemies in the
plains, and slung them to the four corners of the earth.<a class=

Such was the terrible Apocatequil, whose statue was erected on the
mountains, with that of his mother on the one hand and his brother on
the other. He was Prince of Evil and the chief god of the Peruvians.
From Quito to Cuzco every Indian would give all he possessed to
conciliate him. Five priests, two stewards, and a crowd of slaves
served his image. His principal temple was surrounded by a considerable
village, whose inhabitants had no other occupation than to wait on
him.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3710src" href="#xd26e3710" name=

<p>The plaudits which welcomed the first railway train that sped
beneath the Alps, echoing amid their crags and gorges, struck with
death the old phantasms which had so long held sway in the imagination
of the Southern peasantry. The great tunnel was hewn straight through
the stony hearts of giants whom Christianity had tried to slay, and,
failing that, baptised and adopted. It is in the Tyrol <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>that
we find the clearest survivals of the old demons of obstruction, the
mountain monarchs. Such is Jordan the Giant of Kohlh&uuml;tte chasm,
near Ungarkopf, whose story, along with others, is so prettily told by
the Countess Von Gunther. This giant is something of a Ten-jo as to
nose, for he smells &lsquo;human meat&rsquo; where his pursued victims
are hidden, and his snort makes things tremble as before a tempest; but
he has not the intelligence ascribed to large noses, for the boys
ultimately persuade him that the way to cross a stream is to tie a
stone around his neck, and he is drowned. One of the giants of Albach
could carry a rock weighing 10,000 pounds, and his comrades, while
carrying others of 700 pounds, could leap from stone to stone across
rivers, and stoop to catch the trout with their hands as they leaped.
The ferocious Orco, the mountain-ghost who never ages, fulfils the
tradition of his classic name by often appearing as a monstrous black
dog, from whose side stones rebound, and fills the air with a bad smell
(like Mephisto). His employment is hurling wayfarers down precipices.
In her story of the &lsquo;Unholdenhof&rsquo;&mdash;or &lsquo;monster
farm&rsquo; in the Stubeithal&mdash;the Countess Von Gunther describes
the natural character of the mountain demons.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was on this self-same spot that the forester and his son
took up their abode, and they became the dread and abomination of the
whole surrounding country, for they practised, partly openly and partly
in secret, the most manifold iniquities, so that their nature and
bearing grew into something demoniacal. As quarrellers very strong, and
as enemies dreadfully revengeful, they showed their diabolical nature
by the most inhuman deeds, which brought down injury not only on those
against whom their wrath was directed, but also upon their families for
centuries. In the heights of the mountains they turned the beds of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>torrents, and devastated by this means the most
flourishing tracts of land; on other places the Unholde set on fire
whole mountain forests, to allow free room for the avalanches to rush
down and overwhelm the farms. Through certain means they cut holes and
fissures in the rocks, in which, during the summer, quantities of water
collected, which froze in the winter, and then in the spring the
thawing ice split the rocks, which then rolled down into the valleys,
destroying everything before them&#8202;&hellip;. But at last
Heaven&rsquo;s vengeance reached them. An earthquake threw the
forester&rsquo;s house into ruins, wild torrents tore over it, and
thunderbolts set all around it in a blaze; and by fire and water, with
which they had sinned, father and son perished, and were condemned to
everlasting torments. Up to the present day they are to be seen at
nightfall on the mountain in the form of two fiery
boars.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3721src" href="#xd26e3721"
name="xd26e3721src">10</a></p>
<p>Some of these giants, as has been intimated, were converted. Such
was the case with Heimo, who owned and devastated a vast tract of
country on the river Inn, which, however, he bridged&mdash;whence
Innsbruck&mdash;when he became a christian and a monk. This conversion
was a terrible disappointment to the devil, who sent a huge dragon to
stop the building of the monastery; but Heimo attacked the dragon,
killed him, and cut out his tongue. With this tongue, a yard and a half
long, in his hand, he is represented in his statue, and the tongue is
still preserved in the cloister. Heimo became a monk at Wilten, lived a
pious life, and on his death was buried near the monastery. The stone
coffin in which the gigantic bones repose is shown there, and measures
over twenty-eight feet.</p>
<p>Of nearly the same character as the Mountain Demons, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>and
possessing even more features of the Demons of Barrenness, are the
monsters guarding rocky passes. They are distributed through land, sea,
and rivers. The famous rocks between Italy and Sicily bore the names of
dangerous monsters, Scylla and Charybdis, which have now become
proverbial expressions for alternative perils besetting any enterprise.
According to Homer, Scylla was a kind of canine monster with six long
necks, the mouths paved each with three rows of sharp teeth; while
Charybdis, sitting under her fig-tree, daily swallowed the waters and
vomited them up again.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3730src" href=
"#xd26e3730" name="xd26e3730src">11</a> Distantly related to these
fabulous monsters, probably, are many of the old notions of ordeals
undergone between rocks standing close together, or sometimes through
holes in rocks, of which examples are found in Great Britain. An ordeal
of this kind exists at Pera, where the holy well is reached through a
narrow slit. Visitors going there recently on New Year&rsquo;s Day were
warned by the dervish in charge&mdash;&lsquo;Look through it at the
water if you please, but do not essay to enter unless your consciences
are completely free from sin, for as sure as you try to pass through
with a taint upon your soul, you will be gripped by the rock and held
there for ever.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3733src" href=
"#xd26e3733" name="xd26e3733src">12</a> The &lsquo;<span lang=
"it">Bocca della Verit&agrave;</span>&rsquo;&mdash;a great stone face
like a huge millstone&mdash;stands in the portico of the church S.
Maria in Cosmedin at Rome, and its legend is that a suspected person
was required to place his hand through the open mouth; if he swore
falsely it would bite off the hand&mdash;the explanation now given
being that a swordsman was concealed behind to make good the judicial
shrewdness of the stone in case the oath were displeasing to the
authorities.</p>
<p>The myth of Scylla, which relates that she was a beautiful maiden,
beloved by Glaucus, whom Circe through <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>jealousy transformed
to a monster by throwing magic herbs into the well where she was wont
to bathe, is recalled by various European legends. In Thuringia, on the
road to Oberhof, stands the Red Stone, with its rosebush, and a stream
issuing from beneath it, where a beautiful maid is imprisoned. Every
seven years she may be seen bathing in the stream. On one occasion a
peasant passing by heard a sneeze in the rock, and called out,
&lsquo;God help thee!&rsquo; The sneeze and the benediction were
repeated, until at the seventh time the man cried, &lsquo;Oh, thou
cursed witch, deceive not honest people!&rsquo; As he then walked off,
a wailing voice came out of the stone, &lsquo;Oh, hadst thou but only
wished the last time that God would help me<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3746" title="Source: ,">.</span> He would have helped me, and
thou wouldst have delivered me; now I must tarry till the Day of
Judgment!&rsquo; The voice once cried out to a wedding procession
passing by the stone, &lsquo;To-day wed, next year dead;&rsquo; and the
bride having died a year after, wedding processions dread the spot.</p>
<p>The legends of giants and giantesses, so numerous in Great Britain,
are equally associated with rocky mountain-passes, or the boulders they
were supposed to have tossed thence when sportively stoning each other.
They are the Tor of the South and Ben of the North. The hills of
Ross-shire in Scotland are mythological monuments of
<i>Cailliachmore,</i> great woman, who, while carrying a pannier filled
with earth and stones on her back, paused for a moment on a level spot,
now the site of Ben-Vaishard, when the bottom of the pannier gave way,
forming the hills. The recurrence of the names Gog and Magog in
Scotland suggests that in mountainous regions the demons were
especially derived from the hordes of robbers and savages, among whom,
in their uncultivable hills, the ploughshare could never conquer the
spear and club. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203"

of the Grosvenor Gallery in London, 1877, with many beautiful pictures
inspired by European Folklore. They were a pretty garniture for the
cemetery of dead religions. The witch once seen on her broom departing
from the high crags of Cuhillan, cheered by her faithful dwarf, is no
longer unlovely as in the days when she was burned by proxy in some
poor human hag; obedient to art&mdash;a more potent wand than her
own&mdash;she reascends to the clouds from which she was borne, and is
hardly distinguishable from them. Slowly man came to learn with the
poet&mdash;</p>

<p class="line">It was the mountain streams that fed</p>
<p class="line">The fair green plain&rsquo;s amenities.<a class=

<p class="first">Then the giants became fairies, and not a few of these
wore at last the mantles of saints. A similar process has been
undergone by another subject, which finds its pretty epitaph in the
artist&rsquo;s treatment. We saw in two pictures the Dame Blanche of
Normandy, lurking in the ravine beside a stream under the dusk,
awaiting yon rustic wood-cutter who is presently horizontal in the air
in that mad dance, after which he will be found exhausted. As her
mountain-sister is faintly shaped out of the clouds that cap Cuhillan,
this one is an imaginative outgrowth of the twilight shadows, the
silvery glintings of moving clouds mirrored in pools, and her tresses
are long luxuriant grasses. She is of a sisterhood which passes by
hardly perceptible gradations into others, elsewhere
described&mdash;the creations of Illusion and Night. She is not
altogether one of these, however, but a type of more direct
danger&mdash;the peril of fords, torrents, thickets, marshes, and
treacherous pools, which may seem shallow, but are deep.</p>
<p>The water-demons have been already described in their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>obvious aspects, but it is necessary to mention
here the simple obstructive river-demons haunting fords and burns, and
hating bridges. Many tragedies, and many personifications of the forces
which caused them, preceded the sanctity of the title <i>Pontifex</i>.
The torrent that roared across man&rsquo;s path seemed the vomit of a
demon: the sacred power was he who could bridge it. In one of the most
beautiful celebrations of Indra it is said: &lsquo;He tranquillised
this great river so that it might be crossed; he conveyed across it in
safety the sages who had been unable to pass over it, and who, having
crossed, proceeded to realise the wealth they sought; in the
exhilaration of the <i>soma,</i> Indra has done these
deeds.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3777src" href="#xd26e3777"
name="xd26e3777src">14</a> In Ceylon, the demon Tota still casts
malignant spells about fords and ferries.</p>
<p>Many are the legends of the opposition offered by demons to
bridge-building, and of the sacrifices which had to be made to them
before such works could be accomplished. A few specimens must suffice
us. Mr. Dennys relates a very interesting one of the &lsquo;Loh-family
bridge&rsquo; at Shanghai. Difficulty having been found in laying the
foundations, the builder vowed to Heaven two thousand children if the
stones could be placed properly. The goddess addressed said she would
not require their lives, but that the number named would be attacked by
small-pox, which took place, and half the number died. A Chinese author
says, &lsquo;If bridges are not placed in proper positions, such as the
laws of geomancy indicate, they may endanger the lives of thousands, by
bringing about a visitation of small-pox or sore eyes.&rsquo; At
Hang-Chow a tea-merchant cast himself into the river Tsien-tang as a
sacrifice to the Spirit of the dikes, which were constantly being
washed away.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Bridges,&rsquo; to which Mephistopheles
alludes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>so proudly, are frequent in Germany, and most of
them, whether natural or artificial, have diabolical associations. The
oldest structures often have legends in which are reflected the
conditions exacted by evil powers, of those who spanned the fords in
which men had often been drowned. Of this class is the Montafon Bridge
in the Tyrol, and another is the bridge at Ratisbon. The legend of the
latter is a fair specimen of those which generally haunt these ancient
structures. Its architect was apprentice to a master who was building
the cathedral, and laid a wager that he would bridge the Danube before
the other laid the coping-stone of the sacred edifice. But the work of
bridging the river was hard, and after repeated failures the apprentice
began to swear, and wished the devil had charge of the business!
Whereupon he of the cloven foot appeared in guise of a friar, and
agreed to build the fifteen arches&mdash;for a consideration. The fee
was to be the first three that crossed the bridge. The cunning
apprentice contrived that these three should not be human, but a dog, a
cock, and a hen. The devil, in wrath at the fraud, tore the animals to
pieces and disappeared; a procession of monks passed over the bridge
and made it safe; and thereon are carved figures of the three animals.
In most of the stories it is a goat which is sent over and mangled,
that poor animal having preserved its character as scape-goat in a
great deal of the Folklore of Christendom. The Danube was of old
regarded as under the special guardianship of the Prince of Darkness,
who used to make great efforts to obstruct the Crusaders voyaging down
it to rescue the Holy Land from pagans. On one occasion, near the
confluence of the Vilz and Danube, he began hurling huge rocks into the
river-bed from the cliffs; the holy warriors resisted successfully by
signing the cross and singing an anthem, but the huge stone first
thrown caused a whirl <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href=
"#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>and swell in that part of the
river, which were very dangerous until it was removed by engineers.</p>
<p>It is obvious, especially to the English, who have so long found a
defensive advantage in the silver streak of sea that separates them
from the Continent, that an obstacle, whether of mountain-range or sea,
would, at a certain point in the formation of a nation, become as
valuable as at another it might be obstructive. Euphemism is credited
with having given the friendly name &lsquo;Euxine&rsquo; to the rough
&lsquo;Axine&rsquo; Sea,&mdash;&lsquo;terrible to foreigners.&rsquo;
But this is not so certain. Many a tribe has found the Black Sea a
protection and a friend. In the case of mountains, their protective
advantages would account at once for Milton&rsquo;s celebration of
Freedom as a mountain nymph, and for the stupidity of the people that
dwell amid them, so often remarked; the very means of their
independence would also be the cause of their insulation and barbarity.
It is for those who go to and fro that knowledge is increased. The
curious and inquiring are most apt to migrate; the enterprising will
not submit to be shut away behind rocks and mountains; by their
departure there would be instituted, behind the barriers of rock and
hill, a survival of the stupidest. These might ultimately come to
worship their chains and cover their craggy prison-walls with convents
and crosses. The demons of aliens would be their gods. The climbing
Hannibals would be their devils. It might have been expected, after the
passages quoted from Mr. Ruskin concerning the bovine condition of
Alpine peasantries, that he would salute the tunnel through Mont Cenis.
The peasantries who would see in the sub-alpine engine a demon are
extinct. Admiration of the genii of obstruction, and horror of the
demons that vanquished them, are discoverable only in folk-tales
distant enough to be pretty, such as the interesting Serbian story of
&lsquo;Satan&rsquo;s jugglings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207"
href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>and God&rsquo;s might,&rsquo;
in which fairies hiding in successively opened nuts vainly try to
oppose with fire and flood a she-demon pursuing a prince and his bride,
to whose aid at last comes a flash of lightning which strikes the fiend
dead.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful &lsquo;<span lang="fr">Contes d&rsquo;une
Grand&rsquo;m&egrave;re</span>,&rsquo; by George Sand, <i lang="fr">Le
g&eacute;ant Y&eacute;ous</i>, has in it the sense of many fables born
of man&rsquo;s struggle with obstructive nature. With her wonted
felicity she places the scene of this true human drama near the
mountain Y&eacute;ous, in the Pyrenees, whose name is a far-off echo of
Zeus. The summit bore an enormous rock which, seen from a distance,
appeared somewhat like a statue. The peasant Miquelon, who had his
little farm at the mountain&rsquo;s base, whenever he passed made the
sign of the cross and taught his little son Miquel to do the same,
telling him that the great form was that of a pagan god, an enemy of
the human race. An avalanche fell upon the home and garden of Miquelon;
the poor man himself was disabled for life, his house and farm turned
in a moment into a wild mass of stones. Miquel looked up to the summit
of Y&eacute;ous; the giant had disappeared; henceforth it was the
mighty form of an organic monster which the boy saw stretched over what
had once been their happy home and smiling acres. The family went about
begging, Miquelon repeating his strange appeal, &lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">Le g&eacute;ant s&rsquo;est couch&eacute; sur moi.</span>&rsquo;
But when at last the old man dies, the son resolves to fulfil the
silent dream of his life; he will encounter the giant Y&eacute;ous
still in possession of his paternal acres. With eyes of the young world
this boy sees starting up here and there amid the vast debris, the head
of the demon he wishes to crush. He hurls stones hither and thither
where some fearful feature or limb appears. He is filled with rage; his
dreams are filled with attacks on the giant, in which the colossal head
tumbles only to reappear on the shoulders; every broken limb has the
self-repairing power. There is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>no progress. But as the boy
grows, and the contest grows, and need comes, there gathers in Miquel a
desire to clear the ground. When he begins to think, it is no longer
the passion to avenge his father on the stony giant which possesses
him, but to recover their lost garden. Thus, indeed, the giant himself
could alone be conquered. The huge rocks are split by gunpowder, some
fragments are made into fences, others into a comfortable mansion for
Miquel&rsquo;s mother and sisters. When the garden smiles again, and
all are happy the demon form is no longer discoverable.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3805src" href="#xd26e3805" name=
"xd26e3805src">15</a></p>
<p>This little tale interprets with fine insight the demonology of
barrenness and obstruction. The boy&rsquo;s wrath against the
unconscious cause of his troubles is the rage often observed in
children who retaliate upon the table or chair on which they have been
bruised, and it repeats embryologically the rage of the world&rsquo;s
boyhood inspired by ascription of personal motives to inanimate
obstructions. Possibly such wrath might have added something to the
force with which man entered upon his combat with nature; but George
Sand&rsquo;s tale reminds us that whatever was gained in force was lost
in its misdirection. Success came in the proportion that fury was
replaced by the youth&rsquo;s growing recognition that he was dealing
with facts that could not be raged out of existence. It is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>crowned when he makes friends with the
unconquerable remnant of the giant, and sees that he is not altogether
evil.</p>
<p>It is at this stage that the higher Art, conversant with Beauty,
enters to relieve man of many moral wounds received in the struggle.
Clothed with moss and clematis, Y&eacute;ous appears not so hideous
after all. Further invested by the genius of a Turner, he would be
beautiful. Y&eacute;ous is a fair giant after all, only he needed
finish. He is a type of nature.</p>
<p>The boyhood of the world has not passed away with Miquel. We find a
fictitious dualism cherished by the lovers of nature in their belief or
feeling that nature exerts upon man some spiritual influence. Ruskin
has said that in looking from the Campanile at Venice to the circle of
snow which crowns the Adriatic, and then to the buildings which contain
the works of Titian and Tintoret, he has felt unable to answer the
question of his own heart, By which of these&mdash;the nature or the
manhood&mdash;has God given mightier evidence of Himself? So nature may
teach the already taught. While Ruskin looks from the Campanile, the
peasant is fighting the mountain and calling its rocky grandeurs by the
devil&rsquo;s name; before the pictures he kneels. Untaught by art and
science, the mind can derive no elevation from nature, can find no
sympathy in it. It is a false notion that there is any compensation for
the ignorant, denied access to art-galleries, in ability to pass their
Sundays amid natural scenery. Health that may bring them, but mentally
they are still inside the prison-walls from which look the stony eyes
of Fates and Furies. Natural sublimities cannot refine minds crude as
themselves; they must pass through thought before they can feed
thought; it is nature transfigured in art that changes the snow-clad
mountain from a heartless giant to a saviour in snow-pure raiment.

<p class="first">Most beautiful of all the goddesses of India is Maya,
Illusion. In Hindu iconography she is portrayed in drapery of beautiful
colours, with decoration of richest gems and broidery of flowers. From
above her crown falls a veil which, curving above her knees, returns on
the other side, making, as it were, also an apron in which are held
fair animal forms&mdash;prototypes of the creation over which she has
dominion. The youthful yet serious beauty of her face and head is
surrounded with a semi-aureole, fringed with soft lightning, striated
with luminous sparks; and these are background for a cruciform nimbus
made of three clusters of rays. Maya presses her full breasts, from
which flow fountains of milk which fall in graceful streams to mingle
with the sea on which she stands.</p>
<p>So to our Aryan ancestors appeared the spirit that paints the
universe, flushing with tints so strangely impartial fruits forbidden
and unforbidden for man and beast. Mankind are slandered by the
priest&rsquo;s creed, <i lang="la">Populus vult decipi;</i> they are
justly vindicated in Plato&rsquo;s aphorism, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>&lsquo;Unwillingly is the soul deprived of
truth;&rsquo; but still they are deceived. Large numbers are truly
described by Swedenborg, who found hells whose occupants believed
themselves in heaven and sang praises therefor. Such praises we may
hear in the loud laughter proceeding from dens where paradise has been
gained by the cheap charm of a glass of gin or a prostitute&rsquo;s
caress. Serpent finds its ideal in serpent. In heaven, says Swedenborg,
we shall see things as they are. But it is the adage of those who have
lost their paradise, and eat still the dry dust of reality not raised
by science; the general world has not felt that divine curse, or it has
been wiped away so that the most sensual fool may rejoice in feeling
himself God&rsquo;s darling, and pities the paganism of Plato. Man and
beast are certain that they do see things as they are. Maya&rsquo;s
milk is tinctured from the poppies of her robe; untold millions of
misgivings have been put to sleep by her tender bounty; the waters that
sustain her are those of Lethe.</p>
<p>But beneath every illusive heaven Nature stretches also an illusive
hell. The poppies lose their force at last, and under the scourge of
necessity man wakes to find all his paradise of roses turned to briars.
Maya&rsquo;s breast-fountains pass deeper than the surface&mdash;from
one flows soft Lethe, the other issues at last in Phlegethon. Fear is
even a more potent painter than Hope, and out of the manifold menaces
of Nature can at last overlay the fairest illusions. It is a pathetic
fact, that so soon as man begins to think his first theory infers a
will at work wherever he sees no cause; his second, to suppose that it
will harm him!</p>
<p>Harriet Martineau&rsquo;s account of her childish terror caused by
seeing some prismatic colours dancing on the wall of a vacant room she
was entering&mdash;&lsquo;imps&rsquo; that had no worse origin than a
tremulous candelabrum, but which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212"
href="#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>haunted her nerves through
life&mdash;is an experience which may be traced in the haunted
childhood of every nation. There are other phenomena besides these
prismatic colours, which have had an evil name in popular superstition,
despite their beauty. Strange it might seem to a Buddhist that yon
exquisite tree with its blood-red buds should be called the Judas-tree,
as to us that the graceful swan which might be the natural emblem of
purity should be associated with witchcraft! But the student of
mythology will at every moment be impressed by the fact that myths
oftener represent a primitive science than mere fancies and conceits.
The sinuous neck of the swan, its passionate jealousy, and the uncanny
whistle, or else dumbness, found where, from so snowy an outside,
melody might have been looked for, may have made this animal the type
of a double nature. The treacherous brilliants of the serpent, or honey
protected by stings, or the bright blossoms of poisons, would have
trained the instinct which apprehends evil under the apparition of
beauty. This, as we shall have occasion to see, has had a controlling
influence upon the ethical constitution of our nature. But it is at
present necessary to observe that the primitive science generally
reversed the induction of our later philosophy; for where an evil or
pain was discovered in anything, it concluded that such was its
<i lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, and its attractive
qualities were simply a demon&rsquo;s treacherous bait. However, here
are the first stimulants to self-control in the lessons that taught
distrust of appearances.</p>
<p>Because many a pilgrim perished through a confidence in the
lake-pictures of the mirage which led to carelessness about economising
his skin of water, the mirage gained its present name&mdash;Bahr
Sheitan, or Devil&rsquo;s Water. The &lsquo;Will o&rsquo; wisp,&rsquo;
which appeared to promise the night-wanderer <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>warmth or guidance, but led him into a bog, had
its excellent directions as to the place to avoid perverted by an
unhappy misunderstanding into a wilful falsehood, and has been branded
<i lang="la">ignis fatuus</i>. Most of the mimicries in nature
gradually became as suspicious to the primitive observer as
<i>aliases</i> to a magistrate. The thing that seemed to be fire, or
water, but was not; the insect or animal which took its hue or form
from some other, from the leaf-spotted or stem-striped cats to that
innocent insect whose vegetal disguise has gained for it the familiar
name of &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Walking-stick;&rsquo; the humanlike hiss,
laugh, or cry of animals; the vibratory sound or movement which so
often is felt as if near when it really is far; the sand which seems
hard but sinks; the sward which proves a bog;&mdash;all these have
their representation in the demonology of delusion. The Coroados of
Brazil says that the Evil One &lsquo;sometimes transforms (himself)
into a swamp, &amp;c., leads him astray, vexes him, brings him into
danger, and even kills him.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3864src"
href="#xd26e3864" name="xd26e3864src">1</a> It is like an echo of
Burton&rsquo;s account. Terrestrial devils are those lares, genii,
faunes, satyrs, wood-nymphs, foliots, fairies, Robin Good-fellows,
trulli, &amp;c., which, as they are most conversant with men, so they
do them most harm. These are they that dance on heaths and greens, as
Lavater thinks with Trithemius, and, as Olaus Magnus adds, leave that
green circle which we commonly find in plain fields. They are sometimes
seen by old women and children. Hieron. Pauli, in his description of
the city of Bercino, Spain, relates how they have been familiarly seen
near that town, about fountains and hills. &lsquo;Sometimes,&rsquo;
saith Trithemius, &lsquo;they lead simple people into the recesses of
mountains and show them wonderful sights,&rsquo; &amp;c. Giraldus

Real dangers beset the woods and mountain passes, the swamp and
quicksand; in such forms did they haunt the untamed jungles of
imagination!</p>
<p>Over that sea on which Maya stands extends the silvery wand of
Glamour. It descended to the immortal Old Man of the Sea, favourite of
the nymphs, oracle of the coasts, patron of fishermen, friend of
Proteus, who could see through all the sea&rsquo;s depths and assume
all shapes. How many witcheries could proceed from the many-tinted sea
to affect the eyes and enable them to see Triton with his wreathed
horn, and mermaids combing their hair, and marine monsters, and
Aphrodite poised on the white foam! Glaucoma it may be to the
physicians; but Glaucus it is in the scheme of Maya, who has never left
land or sea without her witness. Beside the Polar Sea a Samoyed sailor,
asked by Castr&eacute;n &lsquo;where is Num&rsquo; (<i>i.e.,</i>
Jumala, his god), pointed to the dark distant sea, and said, <i>He is
there</i>.</p>
<p>To the ancients there were two seas,&mdash;the azure above, and that
beneath. The imaginative child in its development passes all those
dreamy coasts; sees in clouds mountains of snow on the horizon, and in
the sunset luminous seas laving golden isles. When as yet to the young
world the shining sun was Berchta, the white fleecy clouds were her
swans. When she descended to the sea, as a thousand stories related, it
was to repeat the course of the sun for all tribes looking on a
westward sea. No one who has read that charming little book, &lsquo;The
Gods in Exile,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3883src" href=

<p class="first">This of course is Heinesque, and has no relation to
any legend of Bertha, but is a fair specimen of mythology in the
making, and is quite in the spirit of many of the myths that have
flitted around sunset on the sea. Whatever the explanation of their
descent, the Shining One and her fleecy retinue were transformed. When
to sea or lake came Berchta (or Perchta), it was as Bertha of the Large
Foot (<i>i.e.,</i> webbed), or of the Long Nose (beak), and her troop
were Swan-maidens. Their celestial character was changed with that of
their mistress. They became familiars of sorcerers and sorceresses. To
&lsquo;wear yellow slippers&rsquo; became the designation of a
witch.</p>
<p>How did these fleecy white cloud-phantoms become demonised? What
connection is there between them and the enticing Lorelei and the
dangerous Rhine-daughters watching over golden treasures, once,
perhaps, metaphors of moonlight ripples? They who have listened to the
wild laughter of these in Wagner&rsquo;s opera, <i lang="de">Das
Rheingold,</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>and their weird &lsquo;Heiayaheia!&rsquo; can
hardly fail to suspect that they became associated with the real human
nymphs whom the summer sun still finds freely sporting in the bright
streams of Russia, Hungary, Austria, and East Germany, naked and not
ashamed. Many a warning voice against these careless Phrynes, who may
have left tattered raiment on the shore to be transfigured in the
silvery waves, must have gone forth from priests and anxious mothers.
Nor would there be wanting traditions enough to impress such warnings.
Few regions have been without such stories as those which the traveller
Hiouen-Thsang (7th century) found in Buddhist chronicles of the
Rakshasis of Ceylon. &lsquo;They waylay the merchants who land in the
isle, and, changing themselves to women of great beauty, come before
them with fragrant flowers and music; attracting them with kind words
to the town of Iron, they offer them a feast, and give themselves up to
pleasure with them; then shut them in an iron prison, and eat them one
after the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is a strong accent of human nature in the usual plot of the
Swan-maiden legend, her garments stolen while she bathes, and her
willingness to pay wondrous prices for them&mdash;since they are her
feathers and her swanhood, without which she must remain for ever
captive of the thief. The stories are told in regions so widely
sundered, and their minor details are so different, that we may at any
rate be certain that they are not all traceable solely to fleecy
clouds. Sometimes the garments of the demoness&mdash;and these beings
are always feminine&mdash;are not feathery, as in the German stories,
but seal-skins, or of nondescript red tissue. Thus, the Envoy Li
Ting-yuan (1801) records a Chinese legend of a man named Ming-ling-tzu,
a poor and worthy farmer without family, who, on going to draw water
from a spring near his house, saw a woman bathing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>in
it. She had hung her clothes on a pine tree, and, in punishment for her
&lsquo;shameless ways&rsquo; and for her fouling the well, he carried
off the dress. The clothing was unlike the familiar Lewchewan in style,
and &lsquo;of a ruddy sunset colour.&rsquo; The woman, having finished
her bath, cried out in great anger, &lsquo;What thief has been here in
broad day? Bring back my clothes, quick.&rsquo; She then perceived
Ming-ling-tzu, and threw herself on the ground before him. He began to
scold her, and asked why she came and fouled his water; to which she
replied that both the pine tree and the well were made by the Creator
for the use of all. The farmer entered into conversation with her, and
pointed out that fate evidently intended her to be his wife, as he
absolutely refused to give up her clothes, while without them she could
not get away. The result was that they were married. She lived with him
for ten years, and bore him a son and a daughter. At the end of that
time her fate was fulfilled: she ascended a tree during the absence of
her husband, and having bidden his children farewell, glided off on a
cloud and disappeared.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3945src" href=
"#xd26e3945" name="xd26e3945src">5</a></p>
<p>In South Africa a parallel myth, in its demonological aspect, bears
no trace of a cloud origin. In this case a Hottentot, travelling with a
Bushwoman and her child, met a troop of wild horses. They were all
hungry; and the woman, taking off a petticoat made of human skin, was
instantly changed into a lioness. She struck down a horse, and lapped
its blood; then, at the request of the Hottentot, who in his terror had
climbed a tree, she resumed her petticoat and womanhood, and the
friends, after a meal of horseflesh, resumed their journey.<a class=

Among the Minussinian Tartars these demons partake of the nature of the
Greek Harpies; they are bloodthirsty vampyre-demons who drink the blood
of men slain in battle, darken <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218"
href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>the air in their flight, and
house themselves in one great black fiend.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3955src" href="#xd26e3955" name="xd26e3955src">7</a> As we go
East the portrait of the Swan-maiden becomes less dark, and she is not
associated with the sea or the under-world. Such is one among the
Malays, related by Mr. Tylor. In the island of Celebes it is said that
seven nymphs came down from the sky to bathe, and were seen by
Kasimbaha, who at first thought them white doves, but in the bath
perceived they were women. He stole the robe of one of them, Utahagi,
and as she could not fly without it, she became his wife and bare him a
son. She was called Utahagi because of a single magic white hair she
had; this her husband pulled out, when immediately a storm arose, and
she flew to heaven. The child was in great grief, and the husband cast
about how he should follow her up into the sky.</p>
<p>The Swan-maiden appears somewhat in the character of a Nemesis in a
Siberian myth told by Mr. Baring-Gould. A certain Samoyed who had
stolen a Swan-maiden&rsquo;s robe, refused to return it unless she
secured for him the heart of seven demon robbers, one of whom had
killed the Samoyed&rsquo;s mother. The robbers were in the habit of
hanging up their hearts on pegs in their tent. The Swan-maiden procured
them. The Samoyed smashed six of the hearts; made the seventh robber
resuscitate his mother, whose soul, kept in a purse, had only to be
shaken over the old woman&rsquo;s grave for that feat to be
accomplished, and the Swan-maiden got back her plumage and flew away
rejoicing.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3960src" href="#xd26e3960" name=
"xd26e3960src">8</a></p>
<p>In Slavonic Folklore the Swan-maiden is generally of a dangerous
character, and if a swan is killed they are careful not to show it to
children for fear they will die. When they appear as ducks, geese, and
other water-fowl, they are apt to be more mischievous than when they
come as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>pigeons; and it is deemed perilous to kill a
pigeon, as among sailors it was once held to kill an albatross.
Afanasief relates a legend which shows that, even when associated with
the water-king, the Tsar Morskoi or Slavonic Neptune, the pigeon
preserves its beneficent character. A king out hunting lies down to
drink from a lake (as in the story related on p. 146), when Tsar
Morskoi seizes him by the beard, and will not release him until he
agrees to give him his infant son. The infant prince, deserted on the
edge of the fatal lake, by advice of a sorceress hides in some bushes,
whence he presently sees twelve pigeons arrive, which, having thrown
off their feathers, disport themselves in the lake. At length a
thirteenth, more beautiful than the rest, arrives, and her
<i>sorochka</i> (shift) Ivan seizes. To recover it she agrees to be his
wife, and, having told him he will find her beneath the waters, resumes
her pigeon-shape and flies away. Beneath the lake he finds a beautiful
realm, and though the Tsar Morskoi treats him roughly and imposes heavy
tasks on him, the pigeon-maiden (Vassilissa) assists him, and they
dwell together happily.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3970src" href=

<p>In Norse Mythology the vesture of the uncanny maid is oftenest a
seal-skin, and a vein of pathos enters the legends. Of the many legends
of this kind, still believed in Sweden and Norway, one has been
pleasantly versified by Miss Eliza Keary. A fisherman having found a
pretty white seal-skin, took it home with him. At night there was a
wailing at his door; the maid enters, becomes his wife, and bears him
three children. But after seven years she finds the skin, and with it
ran to the shore. The eldest child tells the story to the father on his
return home.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">Some of the legends of this character are nearly as
realistic as Mr. Swinburne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Morality&rsquo; of David and
Bathsheba. To imagine the scarcity of wives in regions to which the
primitive Aryan race migrated, we have only to remember the <i>ben
trovato</i> story of Californians holding a ball in honour of a bonnet,
in the days before women had followed them in migration. To steal
Bathsheba&rsquo;s clothes, and so capture her, might at one period have
been sufficiently common in Europe to require all the terrors contained
in the armoury of tradition concerning the demonesses that might so be
taken in, and might so tempt men to take them in. In the end they might
disappear, carrying off treasures in the most prosaic fashion, or
perhaps they might bring to one&rsquo;s doors a small Trojan war. It is
probable that the sentiment of modesty, so far as it is represented in
the shame of nudity, was the result of prudential agencies. Though the
dread of nudity has become in some regions a superstition in the female
mind strong enough to have its martyrs&mdash;as was seen at the sinking
of the <i>Northfleet</i> and the burning hotel in St. Louis&mdash;it is
one that has been fostered by men in distrust of their own animalism.
In barbarous regions, where civilisation introduces clothes, the women
are generally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221</a>]</span>the last to adopt them; and though Mr. Herbert
Spencer attributes this to female conservatism, it appears more
probable that it is because the men are the first to lose their
innocence and the women last to receive anything expensive. It is
noticeable how generally the Swan-maidens are said in the myths to be
captured by violence or stratagem. At the same time the most
unconscious temptress might be the means of breaking up homes and
misleading workmen, and thus become invested with all the wild legends
told of the illusory phenomena of nature in popular mythology.</p>
<p>It is marvellous to observe how all the insinuations of the bane
were followed by equal dexterities in the antedote. The fair tempters
might disguise their intent in an appeal to the wayfarer&rsquo;s
humanity; and, behold, there were a thousand well-attested narratives
ready for the lips of wife and mother showing the demoness appealing
for succour to be fatalest of all!</p>
<p>There is a stone on the M&uuml;ggelsberger, in Altmark, which is
said to cover a treasure; this stone is sometimes called
&lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Altar,&rsquo; and sometimes it is said a fire is
seen there which disappears when approached. It lies on the verge of
Teufelsee,&mdash;a lake dark and small, and believed to be fathomless.
Where the stone lies a castle once stood which sank into the ground
with its fair princess. But from the underground castle there is a
subterranean avenue to a neighbouring hill, and from this hill of an
evening sometimes comes an old woman, bent over her staff. Next day
there will be seen a most beautiful lady combing her long golden hair.
To all who pass she makes her entreaties that they will set her free,
her pathetic appeals being backed by offer of a jewelled casket which
she holds. The only means of liberating her is, she announces, that
some one shall bear her on his shoulders three times round <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>Teufelsee church without looking back. The
experiment has several times been made. One villager at his first round
saw a large hay-waggon drawn past him by four mice, and following it
with his eyes received blows on the ears. Another saw a waggon drawn by
four coal-black fire-breathing horses coming straight against him,
started back, and all disappeared with the cry &lsquo;Lost again for
ever!&rsquo; A third tried and almost got through. He was found
senseless, and on recovering related that when he took the princess on
his shoulders she was light as a feather, but she grew heavier and
heavier as he bore her round. Snakes, toads, and all horrible animals
with fiery eyes surrounded him; dwarfs hurled blocks of wood and stones
at him; yet he did not look back, and had nearly completed the third
round, when he saw his village burst into flames; then he looked
behind&mdash;a blow felled him&mdash;and he seems to have only lived
long enough to tell this story. The youth of K&ouml;pernick are warned
to steel their hearts against any fair maid combing her hair near
Teufelsee. But the folklore of the same neighbourhood admits that it is
by no means so dangerous for dames to listen to appeals of this kind.
In the Gohlitzsee, for example, a midwife was induced to plunge in
response to a call for aid; having aided a little Merwoman in travail,
she was given an apronful of dust, which appeared odd until on shore it
proved to be many thalers.</p>
<p>In countries where the popular imagination, instead of being
scientific, is trained to be religiously retrospective, it relapses at
the slightest touch into the infantine speculations of the human race.
Not long ago, standing at a shop-window in Ostend where a
&lsquo;Japanese Siren&rsquo; was on view, the clever imposture
interested me less than the comments of the passing and pausing
observers. The most frequent wonders seriously expressed were, whether
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>she sang, or combed her hair, or was under a
doom, or had a soul to be saved. Every question related to Circe,
Ulysses and the Sirens, and other conceptions of antiquity. The
Japanese artists rightly concluded they could float their Siren in any
intellectual waters where Jonah in his whale could pass, or a fish
appear with its penny. Nay, even in their primitive form the Sirens
find their kith and kin still haunting all the coasts of northern
Europe. A type of the Irish and Scottish Siren may be found in the very
complete legend of one seen by John Reid, shipmaster of Cromarty. With
long flowing yellow hair she sat half on a rock, half in water, nude
and beautiful, half woman half fish, and John managed to catch and hold
her tight till she had promised to fulfil three wishes; then, released,
she sprang into the sea. The wishes were all fulfilled, and to one of
them (though John would never reveal it) the good-luck of the Reids was
for a century after ascribed.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4032src" href=
"#xd26e4032" name="xd26e4032src">10</a></p>
<p>The scene of this legend is the &lsquo;Dropping Cave,&rsquo; and
significantly near the Lover&rsquo;s Leap. One of John&rsquo;s wishes
included the success of his courtship. These Caves run parallel with
that of Venusberg, where the minstrel Tannh&auml;user is tempted by
Venus and her nymphs. Heine finishes off his description of this Frau
Venus by saying he fancied he met her one day in the Place
Br&eacute;da. &lsquo;What do you take this lady to be?&rsquo; asked he
of Balzac, who was with him. &lsquo;She is a mistress,&rsquo; replied
Balzac. &lsquo;A duchess rather,&rsquo; returned Heine. But the friends
found on further explanation that they were both quite right.
Venus&rsquo; doves, soiled for a time, were spiritualised at last and
made white, while the snowy swan grew darker. An old German word for
swan, <i>elbiz</i>, originally denoting its whiteness (<i>albus</i>),
furthered its connection with all &lsquo;elfish&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>beings&mdash;<i>elf</i> being from the same
word, meaning white; but, as in Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;<span lang=
"de">Erl K&ouml;nig</span>,&rsquo; often disguising a dark character.
The Swan and the Pigeon meet (with some modifications) as symbols of
the Good and Evil powers in the legend of Lohengrin. The witch
transforms the boy into a Swan, which, however, draws to save his
sister, falsely accused of his murder, the Knight of the Sangreal, who,
when the mystery of his holy name is inquired into by his too curious
bride, is borne away by white doves. These legends all bear in them,
however faintly, the accent of the early conflict of religion with the
wild passions of mankind. Their religious bearings bring us to
inquiries which must be considered at a later phase of our work. But
apart from purely moral considerations, it is evident that there must
have been practical dangers surrounding the early social chaos amid
which the first immigrants in Europe found themselves.</p>
<p>Although the legend of Lady Godiva includes elements of another
origin, it is probable that in the fate of Peeping Tom there is a
distant reflection of the punishment sometimes said to overtake those
who gazed too curiously upon the Swan-maiden without her feathers. The
devotion of the nude lady of Coventry would not be out of keeping with
one class of these mermaiden myths. There is a superstition, now
particularly strong in Iceland, that all fairies are children of Eve,
whom she hid away on an occasion when the Lord came to visit her,
because they were not washed and presentable. So he condemned them to
be for ever invisible. This superstition seems to be related to an old
debate whether these pr&aelig;ternatural beings are the children of
Adam and Eve or not. A Scotch story bears against that conclusion. A
beautiful nymph, with a slight robe of green, came from the sea and
approached a fisherman while he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>reading his Bible.
She asked him if it contained any promise of mercy for her. He replied
that it contained an offer of salvation to &lsquo;all the children of
Adam;&rsquo; whereupon with a loud shriek she dashed into the sea
again. Euphemism would co-operate with natural compassion in saying a
good word for &lsquo;the good little people,&rsquo; whether hiding in
earth or sea. In Altmark, &lsquo;Will-o&rsquo;-wisps&rsquo; are
believed to be the souls of unbaptized children&mdash;sometimes of
lunatics&mdash;unable to rest in their graves; they are called
&lsquo;Light-men,&rsquo; and it is said that though they may sometimes
mislead they often guide rightly, especially if a small coin be thrown
them,&mdash;this being also an African plan of breaking a
sorcerer&rsquo;s spell. Christianity long after its advent in Germany
had to contend seriously with customs and beliefs found in some
lakeside villages where the fishermen regarded themselves as in
friendly relations with the pr&aelig;ternatural guardians of the
waters, and unto this day speak of their presiding sea-maiden as a Holy
Fr&auml;ulein. They hear her bells chiming up from the depths in holy
seasons to mingle with those whose sounds are wafted from church
towers; and it seems to have required many fables, told by prints of
fishermen found sitting lifeless on their boats while listening to
them, to gradually transfer reverence to the new christian fairy.</p>

<p class="first">The temptations of fishermen to secure objects seen at
the bottom of transparent lakes, sometimes appearing like boxes or
lumps of gold, and even more reflections of objects in the upper world
or air, must have been sources of danger; there are many tales of their
being so beguiled to destruction. These things were believed treasures
of the little folk who live under water, and would not part with them
except on payment. In Blumenthal lake, &rsquo;tis said, there is an
iron-bound yellow coffer which fishermen often have tried to raise, but
their cords are cut as it nears the surface. At the bottom of the same
lake valuable clothing is seen, and a woman who once tried to secure it
was so nearly drowned that it is thought safer to leave it. The legends
of sunken towns (as in Lake Paarsteinchen and Lough Neagh), and bells
(whose chimes may be heard on certain sacred days), are probably
variants of this class of delusions. They are often said to have been
sunk by some final vindictive stroke of a magician or witch resolved to
destroy the city no longer trusting them. Landslides, engulfing seaside
homes, might originate legends like that of King Gradlon&rsquo;s
daughter Dahut, whom the Breton peasant sees in rough weather on rocks
around Poul-Dahut, where she unlocked the sluice-gates on the city Is
in obedience to her fiend-lover.</p>
<p>If it be remembered that less than fifty years ago Dr.
Belon<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4237src" href="#xd26e4237" name=
"xd26e4237src">11</a> thought it desirable to anatomise gold fishes,
and prove in various ways that it is a fallacy to suppose they feed on
pure gold (as many a peasant near Lyons declares of the laurets sold
daily in the market), it will hardly be thought wonderful that perilous
visions of precious things were seen by early fishermen in pellucid
depths, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229"
name="pb229">229</a>]</span>these should at last be regarded as
seductive arts of Lorelei, who have given many lakes and rivers the
reputation of requiring one or more annual victims.</p>
<p>Possibly it was through accumulation of many dreams about beautiful
realms beneath the sea or above the clouds that suicide became among
the Norse folk so common. It was a proverb that the worst end was to
die in bed, and to die by suicide was to be like Egil, and Omund, and
King Hake, like nearly all the heroes who so passed to Valhalla. The
Northman had no doubt concerning the paradise to which he was going,
and did not wish to reach it enfeebled by age. But the time would come
when the earth and human affection must assert their claims, and the
watery tribes be pictured as cruel devourers of the living. Even so
would the wood-nymphs and mountain-nymphs be degraded, and fearful
legends of those lost and wandering in dark forests be repeated to
shuddering childhood. The actual dangers would mask themselves in the
endless disguises of illusion, the wold and wave be peopled with cruel
and treacherous seducers. Thus suicide might gradually lose its charms,
and a dismal underworld of heartless gnomes replace the grottoes and
fairies.</p>
<p>We may close this chapter with a Scottish legend relating to the
&lsquo;Shi&rsquo;ichs,&rsquo; or Men of Peace, in which there is a
strange intimation of a human mind dreaming that it dreams, and so far
on its way to waking. A woman was carried away by these shadowy beings
in order that she might suckle her child which they had previously
stolen. During her retention she once observed the Shi&rsquo;ichs
anointing their eyes from a caldron, and seizing an opportunity, she
managed to anoint one of her own eyes with the ointment. With that one
eye she now saw the secret abode and all in it &lsquo;as they really
were.&rsquo; The deceptive splendour <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>had vanished. The
gaudy ornaments of a fairy grot had become the naked walls of a gloomy
cavern. When this woman had returned to live among human beings again,
her anointed eye saw much that others saw not; among other things she
once saw a &lsquo;man of peace,&rsquo; invisible to others, and asked
him about her child. Astonished at being recognised, he demanded how
she had been able to discover him; and when she had confessed, he spit
in her eye and extinguished it for ever. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="first">From the little night which clings to man even by
day&mdash;his own shadow&mdash;to the world&rsquo;s great shade of
darkness, innumerable are the coverts from which have emerged the black
procession of phantoms which have haunted the slumbers of the world,
and betrayed the enterprise of man.</p>
<p>How strange to the first man seemed that shadow walking beside him,
from the time when he saw it as a ghost tracking its steps and giving
him his name for a ghost, on to the period in which it seemed the
emanation of an occult power, as to them who brought their sick into
the streets to be healed by the passing shadow of Peter; and still on
to the day when Beaumont wrote&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Our acts our angels are, or good or ill,</p>
<p class="line">Our fatal shadows that walk by us still;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">or that in which Goethe found therein the mystical
symbol of the inward arrest of our moral development, and said
&lsquo;No man can jump off of his shadow.&rsquo; And then from the
culture of Europe we pass to the Feejee-Islanders, and find them
believing that every man has two spirits. One is his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>shadow, which goes to Hades; the other is his
image as reflected in water, and it is supposed to stay near the place
where the man dies.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4274src" href=
"#xd26e4274" name="xd26e4274src">1</a> But, like the giants of the
Brocken, these demons of the Shadow are trembled at long after they are
known to be the tremblers themselves mirrored on air. Have we not
priests in England still fostering the belief that the baptized child
goes attended by a white spirit, the unbaptized by a dark one? Why then
need we apologise for the Fijians?</p>
<p>But little need be said here of demons of the Dark, for they are
closely related to the phantasms of Delusion, of Winter, and others
already described. Yet have they distinctive characters. As many as
were the sunbeams were the shadows; every goddess of the Dawn (Ushas)
cast her shadow; every Day was swallowed up by Night. This is the
cavern where hide the treacherous Panis (fog) in Vedic mythology, they
who steal and hide Indra&rsquo;s cows; this is the realm of Hades (the
invisible); this is the cavern of the hag Th&ouml;kk (dark) in
Scandinavian mythology,&mdash;she who alone of all in the universe
refused to weep for Baldur when he was shut up in Helheim, where he had
been sent by the dart of his blind brother H&ouml;dr (darkness). In the
cavern of Night sleep the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, and Barbarossa,
and all slumbering phantoms whose genius is the night-winged raven.
Thorr, the Norse Hercules, once tried to lift a cat&mdash;as it seemed
to him&mdash;from the ground; but it was the great mid-earth serpent
which encircles the whole earth. Impossible feat as it was for
Thorr&mdash;who got only one paw of the seeming cat off the
ground&mdash;in that glassless and gasless era, invention has
accomplished much in that direction; but the black Cat is still
domiciled securely among idols of the mental cave.</p>
<p>There is an Anglo-Saxon word, <i>cof-godas</i> (lit. cove-gods),
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>employed as the equivalent of the Latin
<i>lares</i> (the Penates, too, are interpreted as <i>cof-godu,
cofa</i> signifying the inner recess of a house, <i>penetrale</i>). The
word in German corresponding to this <i>cofa</i>, is <i>koben</i>; and
from this Hildebrand conjectures <i>kob-old</i> to be derived. The
latter part of the word he supposes to be walt (one who &lsquo;presides
over,&rsquo; <i>e.g.</i>, Walter); so that the original form would be
<i>kob-walt</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4311src" href="#xd26e4311"
name="xd26e4311src">2</a> Here, then, in the recesses of the household,
among the least enlightened of its members&mdash;the menials, who still
often neutralise the efforts of rational people to dispel the delusions
of their children&mdash;the discredited deities and demons of the past
found refuge, and through a little baptismal change of names are
familiars of millions unto this day. In the words of the ancient
Hebrew, &lsquo;they lay in their own houses prisoners of darkness,
fettered with the bonds of a long night.&rsquo; &lsquo;No power of the
fire might give them light, neither could the bright flames of the
stars lighten that horrible night.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4315src" href="#xd26e4315" name="xd26e4315src">3</a> Well is it
added, &lsquo;Fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succours
which reason offereth,&rsquo; a truth which finds ample illustration in
the Kobolds. These imaginary beings were naturally associated with the
dark recesses of mines. There they gave the name to our metal
<i>Cobalt</i>. The value of Cobalt was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>not understood until
the 17th century, and the metal was first obtained by the Swedish
chemist Brandt in 1733. The miners had believed that the silver was
stolen away by Kobolds, and these &lsquo;worthless&rsquo; ores left in
its place. Nickel had the like history, and is named after Old Nick. So
long did those Beauties slumber in the cavern of Ignorance till Science
kissed them with its sunbeam, and led them forth to decorate the
world!</p>

<p class="first">It could only have been at a comparatively late period
of social development that Sancho&rsquo;s benediction on the inventor
of sleep could have found general response. The Red Indian found its
helplessness fatal when the &lsquo;Nick of the Woods&rsquo; was abroad;
the Scotch sailor found in it a demon&rsquo;s opiate when the
&lsquo;Nigg of the Sea&rsquo; was gathering his storms above the
sleeping watchman. It was among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235"

co&ouml;peration of darkness with evil-doers.</p>

<p class="line">They are familiar with the dark terrors of

</div>
<p class="first">Besides this fact that the night befriends and masks
every treacherous foe, it is also to be remembered that man is weakest
at night. Not only is he weaker than by day in the veil drawn over his
senses, but physiologically also. When the body is wearied out by the
toils or combats of the day, and the mind haunted by dreams of danger,
there are present all the terrors which Byron portrays around the
restless pillow of Sardanapalus. The war-horse of the day becomes a
night-mare in the darkness. In the Heimskringla it is recorded:
&lsquo;Vanland, Svegdir&rsquo;s son, succeeded his father and ruled
over the Upsal domain. He was a great warrior, and went far around in
different lands. Once he took up his winter abode in Finland with Snio
the Old, and got his daughter Drisa in marriage; but in spring he set
out leaving Drisa behind, and although he had promised to return within
three years he did not come back for ten. Then Drisa sent a message to
the witch Hulda; and sent Visbur, her son by Vanland, to Sweden. Drisa
bribed the witch-wife Hulda, either that she should bewitch Vanland to
return to Finland or kill him. When this witch-work was going on
Vanland was at Upsal, and a great desire came over him to go to
Finland, but his friends and counsellors advised him against it, and
said the witchcraft of the Fin people showed itself in this desire of
his to go there. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236"
name="pb236">236</a>]</span>then became very drowsy, and laid himself
down to sleep; but when he had slept but a little while he cried out,
saying, &lsquo;Mara was treading on him.&rsquo; His men hastened to
help him; but when they took hold of his head she trod on his legs, and
when they laid hold of his legs she pressed upon his head; and it was
his death.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4387src" href="#xd26e4387"
name="xd26e4387src">5</a></p>
<p>This witch is, no doubt, Hildur, a Walkyr of the Edda, leading
heroes to Walhalla. Indeed, in Westphalia, nightmare is called
Walriderske. It is a curious fact that &lsquo;Mara&rsquo; should be
preserved in the French word for nightmare, <i>Cauche-mar</i>,
&lsquo;cauche&rsquo; being from Latin <i lang="la">calcare,</i> to
tread. Through Teutonic folklore this Night-demon of many names, having
floated from England in a sieve paddled with cow-ribs, rides to the
distress of an increasingly unheroic part of the population. Nearly
always still the &lsquo;Mahrt&rsquo; is said to be a pretty
woman,&mdash;sometimes, indeed, a sweetheart is involuntarily
transformed to one,&mdash;every rustic settlement abounding with tales
of how the demoness has been captured by stopping the keyhole, calling
the ridden sleeper by his baptismal name, and making the sign of the
cross; by such process the wicked beauty appears in human form, and is
apt to marry the sleeper, with usually evil results. The fondness of
cats for getting on the breasts of sleepers, or near their breath, for
warmth, has made that animal a common form of the &lsquo;Mahrt.&rsquo;
Sometimes it is a black fly with red ring around its neck. This
demoness is believed to suffer more pain than it inflicts, and vainly
endeavours to destroy herself.</p>
<p>In savage and nomadic times sound sleep being an element of danger,
the security which required men to sleep on their arms demanded also
that they should sleep as it were with one eye open. Thus there might
have arisen both the intense vividness which demons acquired by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span>blending subjective and objective impressions,
and the curious inability, so frequent among barbarians and not unknown
among the men civilised, to distinguish dream from fact. The habit of
day-dreaming seems, indeed, more general than is usually supposed.
Dreams haunt all the region of our intellectual twilight,&mdash;the
borderland of mystery, where rise the sources of the occult and the
mystical which environ our lives. The daily terrors of barbarous life
avail to haunt the nerves of civilised people, now many generations
after they have passed away, with special and irrational shudders at
certain objects or noises: how then must they have haunted the dreams
of humanity when, like the daughter of Nathan the Wise, rescued from
flames, it passed the intervals of strife</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e1623">With nerves unstrung through fear,</p>
<p class="line">And fire and flame in all she sees or fancies;</p>
<p class="line">Her soul awake in sleep, asleep when wide awake?</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Among the sources of demoniac beliefs few indeed are
more prolific than Dreams. &lsquo;The witchcraft of sleep,&rsquo; says
Emerson, &lsquo;divides with truth the empire of our lives. This soft
enchantress visits two children lying locked in each other&rsquo;s
arms, and carries them asunder by wide spans of land and sea, wide
intervals of time. &rsquo;Tis superfluous to think of the dreams of
multitudes; the astonishment remains that one should dream; that we
should resign so quietly this deifying reason and become the theatre of
delusions, shows, wherein time, space, persons, cities, animals, should
dance before us in merry and mad confusion, a delicate creation
outdoing the prime and flower of actual nature, antic comedy
alternating with horrid spectres. Or we seem busied for hours and days
in peregrinations over seas and lands, in earnest dialogues, strenuous
actions for nothings and absurdities, cheated by spectral jokes, and
waking suddenly with ghostly laughter, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>to be rebuked by the
cold lonely silent midnight, and to rake with confusion in memory among
the gibbering nonsense to find the motive of this contemptible
cachinnation.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4413src" href=
"#xd26e4413" name="xd26e4413src">6</a></p>
<p>It has always been the worst of periods of religious excitement that
they shape the dreams of old and young, and find there a fearful and
distorted, but vivid and realistic, embodiment of their feverish
experiences. In the days of witchcraft thousands visited the
Witches&rsquo; Sabbaths, as they believed and danced in the Walpurgis
orgies, borne (by hereditary orthodox canon) on their own brooms up
their own chimneys; and to-day, by the same morbid imaginations, the
victims are able to see themselves or others elongated, levitated,
floating through the air. If people only knew how few are ever really
wide-awake, these spiritual nightmares would soon reach their
termination. The natural terrors before which helpless man once
cowered, have been prolonged past all his real victories over his
demons by a succession of such nightmares, so that the vulgar religion
might be portrayed somewhat as Richard Wagner described his first
tragedy, in which, having killed off forty-two of his characters, he
had to bring them back as ghosts to carry on the fifth act!</p>
<p>The perils of darkness, as ambush of foes human and animal,
concealer of pitfalls, misguider of footsteps, misdirector of aims,
were more real than men can well imagine in an age of gaslight plus the
policeman. The myth of Joshua commanding the sun to stand still; the
cry of Ajax when darkness fell on the combat, &lsquo;Grant me but to
see!&rsquo; refer us to the region from which come all childish
shudders at going into the dark. The limit of human courage is reached
where its foe is beyond the reach of its force. Fighting in the dark
may even be suicidal. A German <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239"
href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>fable of blindfold
zeal&mdash;the awakened sleeper demolishing his furniture and knocking
out his own teeth in the attempt to punish cats&mdash;has its tragical
illustrations also. But none of these actual dangers have been of more
real evil to man than the demonisation of them. This rendered his very
skill a blunder, his energy weakness. If it was bad to retreat in the
dusk from an innocent bush into an unrecognised well, it was worse to
meet the ghost with rune or crucifix and find it an assassin. When man
fights with his shadow, he instantly makes it the demon he fears;
ghoul-like it preys upon his paralysed strength, vampyre-like it sucks
his blood, and he is consigned disarmed to the evil that is no shadow.
The Scottish Sinclair marching through Norway, in the 16th century,
owes his monument at Wiblungen rather to the magpie believed to precede
him as a spy, with night and day upon its wings, than to his own
prowess or power.</p>
<p>In a sense all demons, whatever their shapes, are the ancient brood
of night. Mental darkness, even more moral darkness within, supply the
phantasmagoria in which unknown things shape themselves as demons. Esau
is already reconciled, but guilty Jacob must still wrestle with him as
a phantom of Fear till daybreak. A work has already been written on
&lsquo;The Night-side of Nature,&rsquo; but it would require many
volumes to tell the story of what monsters have been conjured out of
the kind protecting darkness. How great is the darkness which man makes
for himself out of the imagination which should be his light and
vision! Much of the so-called &lsquo;religion&rsquo; of our time is but
elaborate demoniculture and artificial preservation of mental
Walpurgis-nights. Nott (Night) says the Edda rides first on her horse
called Hrimfaxi (frost-maned), which every morning as he ends his
course bedews the earth with the foam that falls from his bit. Though
the horse of Day&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href=
"#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>Skinfaxi, or
Shining-mane&mdash;follows hard after her, yet the foam is by no means
drunk up by his fires. Foam of the old phantasms still lingers in our
medi&aelig;val liturgies, and even falls afresh where the daylight is
shut out that altar-candles may burn, or for other dark seances are
prepared the conditions necessary for whatsoever loves not the
light.</p>
<p>What we call the Dark Ages were indeed spiritually a perpetual
seance with lights lowered. Nay, human superstition was able to turn
the very moon and stars into mere bluish night-tapers, giving just
light enough to make the darkness visible in fantastic shapes
fluttering around the Prince of Darkness,&mdash;or Non-existence in
Chief! How much of the theosophic speculation of our time is the mere
artificial conservation of that darkness? How much that still flits
bat-winged from universities, will, in the future, be read with the
same wonder as that with which even the more respectable bats can now
read account of the midnight brood which now for the most part sleep
tranquilly in such books as Burton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Anatomy of
Melancholy&rsquo;? &lsquo;There are,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;certain
spirits which Miraldus calls Ambulones, that walk about midnight on
great heaths and desert places, which (saith Lavater) draw men out of
their way, and lead them all night by a byway, or quite bar them of
their way. These have several names in several places. We commonly call
them Pucks. In the deserts of Lop, in Asia, such illusions of walking
spirits are often perceived, as you may read in M. Paulus, the
Venetian, his travels. If one lose his company by chance, these devils
will call him by his name, and counterfeit voices of his companions to
seduce him. Lavater and Cicogna have a variety of examples of spirits
and walking devils in this kind. Sometimes they sit by the wayside to
give men falls, and make <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href=
"#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>their horses stumble and start as
they ride (according to the narration of that holy man Ketellus in
Nubrigensis, that had an especial grace to see devils); and if a man
curse and spur his horse for stumbling, they do heartily rejoice at
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While observing a spirited and imaginative picture by Macallum of
the Siege of Jerusalem, it much interested me to observe the greater or
less ease with which other visitors discovered the portents in the air
which, following the narrative of Josephus, the artist had vaguely
portrayed. The chariots and horsemen said to have been seen before that
event were here faintly blent with indefinite outlines of clouds; and
while some of the artist&rsquo;s friends saw them with a distinctness
greater, perhaps, than that with which they impressed the eye of the
artist himself, others could hardly be made to see anything except
shapeless vapour, though of course they all agreed that they were there
and remarkably fine.</p>
<p>It would seem that thus, in a London studio, there were present all
the mental pigments for frescoing the air and sky with those visions of
a&euml;rial armies or huntsmen which have become so normal in history
as to be, in a subjective sense, natural. In the year 1763, an author,
styling himself Theophilus Insulanus, published at Edinburgh a book on
Second-Sight, in which he related more than a hundred instances of the
power he believed to exist of seeing events before they had occurred,
and whilst, of course, they did not exist. It is not difficult in
reading them to see that they are all substantially one and the same
story, and that the sight in operation was indeed second; for man or
woman, at once imaginative and illiterate, have a second and
supernumerary pair of eyes inherited from the traditional superstitions
and ghost stories which fill all the air they breathe from the cradle
to the grave. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>While the mind is in this condition, that same
nature whose apparitions and illusions originally evoked and fostered
the glamoury, still moves on with her minglings of light and shade,
cloud and mirage, giving no word of explanation. There are never
wanting the shadowy forms without that cast their shuttles to the dark
idols of the mental cave, together weaving subtle spells round the
half-waking mind.</p>
<p>In the year 1743 all the North of England and Scotland was in alarm
on account of some spectres which were seen on the mountain of Souter
Fell in Cumberland. The mountain is about half-a-mile high. On a summer
evening a farmer and his servant, looking from Wilton Hall, half a mile
off, saw the figures of a man and a dog pursuing some horses along the
mountain-side, which is very steep; and on the following morning they
repaired to the place, expecting to find dead bodies, but finding none.
About one year later a troop of horsemen were seen riding along the
same mountain-side by one of the same persons, the servant, who then
called others who also saw the <span class="corr" id="xd26e4439" title=
"Source: aerial">a&euml;rial</span> troopers. After a year had elapsed
the above vision was attested before a magistrate by two of those who
saw it. The event occurred on the eve of the Rebellion, when horsemen
were exercising, and when also the popular mind along the Border may be
supposed to have been in a highly excited condition.</p>
<p>What was seen on this strongly-authenticated occasion? Was anything
seen? None can tell. It is open to us to believe that there may have
been some play of mirage. As there are purely a&euml;rial echoes, so
are there a&euml;rial reflectors for the eye. On the other hand, the
vision so nearly resembles the spectral processions which have passed
through the mythology of the world, that we can never be sure that it
was not the troop of King Arthur, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>emerging from Avallon to
announce the approaching strife. A few fleecy, strangely-shaped clouds,
chasing each other along the hillside in the evening&rsquo;s dusk would
have amply sufficed to create the latter vision, and the danger of the
time would easily have supplied all the Second-Sight required to reveal
it to considerable numbers. In questions of this kind a very small
circumstance&mdash;a phrase, a name, perhaps&mdash;may turn the balance
of probabilities. Thus it may be noted that, in the instance just
related, the vision was seen on the steep side of Souter Fell.
<i>Fell</i> means a hill or a steep rock, as in Drachenfels. But as to
Souter, although, as Mr. Robert Ferguson says, the word may originally
have meant sheep,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4449src" href="#xd26e4449"
name="xd26e4449src">7</a> it is found in Scotland used as
&lsquo;shoemaker&rsquo; in connection with the fabulous giants of that
region. Sir Thomas Urquhart, in the seventeenth century, relates it as
the tradition of the two promontories of Cromarty, called
&lsquo;Soutars,&rsquo; that they were the work-stools of two giants who
supplied their comrades with shoes and buskins. Possessing but one set
of implements, they used to fling these to each other across the
opening of the firth, where the promontories are only two miles apart.
In process of time the name Soutar, shoemaker, was bequeathed by the
craftsmen to their stools. It is not improbable that the name gradually
connected itself with other places bearing traditions connecting them
with the fabulous race, and that in this way the Souter Fell, from
meaning in early times much the same as Giants&rsquo; Hill, preserved
even in 1743&ndash;44 enough of the earlier uncanny associations to
awaken the awe of Borderers in a time of rebellion. The vision may
therefore have been seen by light which had journeyed all the way from
the mythologic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>heavens of ancient India: substantially
subjective&mdash;such stuff as dreams and dreamers are made of&mdash;no
doubt there were outer clouds, shapes and afterglows enough, even in
the absence of any <i>fata morgana</i> to supply canvas and pigment to
the cunning artist that hides in the eye.</p>
<p>In an old tale, the often-slain Vampyre-bat only requests, with
pathos, that his body may be laid where no sunlight, but only the
moonlight, will fall on it&mdash;only that! But it is under the
moonshine that it always gains new life. No demon requires absolute
darkness, but half-darkness, in which to live: enough light to disclose
a Somewhat, but not enough to define and reveal its nature, is just
what has been required for the bat-eyes of fable and phantasy, which
can make vampyre of a sparrow or giant out of a windmill.</p>
<p><i>Glamour!</i> A marvellous history has this word of the artists
and poets,&mdash;sometimes meaning the charm with which the eye invests
any object; or, in Wordsworth&rsquo;s phrase, &lsquo;the light that
never was on land or sea.&rsquo; But no artist or poet ever rose to the
full height of the simple term itself, which well illustrates
Emerson&rsquo;s saying, &lsquo;Words are fossil poetry.&rsquo;
Professor Cowell of Cambridge says: &lsquo;Gl&aacute;m, or in the
nominative <i>Gl&aacute;mr,</i> is also a poetical name for the Moon.
It does not actually occur in the ancient literature, but it is given
in the glossary in the Prose Edda in the list of the very old words for
the Moon.&rsquo; Vigfusson in his dictionary says, &lsquo;The word is
interesting on account of its identity with Scot. <i>Glamour</i>, which
shows that the tale of <i>Glam</i> was common to Scotland and Iceland,
and this much older than Grettir (in the year 1014).&rsquo; The Ghost
or Goblin Glam seems evidently to have arisen from a personification of
the delusive and treacherous effects of moonlight on the benighted
traveller, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=

<p class="line">Quale per incertam lunam sub luce malign&acirc;,</p>
<p class="line">Est iter in sylvis.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now, there is a curious old Sanskrit word, <i>glau</i>
or <i>gl&aacute;v</i>, which is explained in all the old native
lexicons as meaning &lsquo;the moon.&rsquo; It might either be taken as
&lsquo;waning,&rsquo; or in a casual sense &lsquo;obscuring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following lines from an early medi&aelig;val poet, Bh&aacute;sa
(seventh century), will illustrate the deceptive character of moonlight
from a Hindu point of view. The strong and wild Norse imagination
delights in what is terrible and gloomy: the Hindu loves to dwell on
the milder and quieter aspects of human life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cat laps the moonbeams in the bowl of water, thinking
them to be milk: the elephant thinks that the moonbeams, threaded
through the intervals of the trees, are the fibres of the lotus-stalk.
The woman snatches at the moonbeams as they lie on the bed, taking them
for her muslin garment: oh, how the moon, intoxicated with radiance,
bewilders all the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A similar passage, no doubt imitated from this, is also quoted:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bewildered herdsmen place the pails under the cows,
thinking that the milk is flowing; the maidens also put the blue lotus
blossom in their ears, thinking that it is the white; the
mountaineer&rsquo;s wife snatches up the jujube fruit, avaricious for
pearls. Whose mind is not led astray by the thickly clustering
moonbeams?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4495src" href="#xd26e4495"
name="xd26e4495src">8</a></p>
<p>In the Icelandic legend of the struggle between the hero Grettir,
translated by Magn&uacute;ssen and Morris (London, 1869), the saga
supplies a scenery as arch&aelig;ological as if the philologists had
been consulted. &lsquo;Bright moonlight was there without, and the
drift was broken, now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href=
"#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>drawn over the moon, now driven
off from her; and even as Glam fell, a cloud was driven from the moon,
and Glam glared up against her.&rsquo; When the hero beheld these
glaring eyes of the giant Ghost, he felt some fiendish craft in them,
and could not draw his short sword, and &lsquo;lay well nigh
&rsquo;twixt home and hell.&rsquo; This half-light of the moon, which
robs the Strong of half his power, is repeated in Glam&rsquo;s curse:
&lsquo;Exceedingly eager hast thou sought to meet me, Grettir, but no
wonder will it be deemed, though thou gettest no good hap of me; and
this I must tell thee, that thou now hast got half the strength and
manhood which was thy lot if thou hadst not met me: now I may not take
from thee the strength which thou hast got before this; but that may I
rule, that thou shalt never be mightier than now thou art &hellip;
therefore this weird I lay on thee, ever in those days to see these
eyes with thine eyes, and thou wilt find it hard to be alone&mdash;and
that shalt drag thee unto death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Moon-demon&rsquo;s power is limited to the spell of illusion he
can cast. Presently he is laid low; the &lsquo;short sword&rsquo; of a
sunbeam pales, decapitates him. But after Glam is burned to cold coals,
and his ashes buried in skin of a beast &lsquo;where sheep-pastures
were fewest, or the ways of men,&rsquo; the spell lay upon the
hero&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;Grettir said that his temper had been nowise
bettered by this, that he was worse to quiet than before, and that he
deemed all trouble worse than it was; but that herein he found the
greatest change, in that he was become so fearsome a man in the dark,
that he durst go nowhither alone after nightfall, for then he seemed to
see all kinds of horrors. And that has fallen since into a proverb,
that Glam lends eyes, or gives Glamsight to those who see things nowise
as they are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In reading which one may wonder how this world would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>look
if for a little moment one&rsquo;s eyes could be purged of glamour.
Even at the moon&rsquo;s self one tries vainly to look: where Hindu and
Zulu see a hare, the Arab sees coils of a serpent, and the Englishman
sees a man; and the most intelligent of these several races will find
it hard to see in the moon aught save what their primitive ancestors
saw. And this small hint of the degree to which the wisest, like
Merlin, are bound fast in an air-prison by a Vivien whose spells are
spun from themselves, would carry us far could we only venture to
follow it out. &lsquo;The Moon,&rsquo; observed Dr. Johnson
unconsciously, &lsquo;has great influence in vulgar philosophy.&rsquo;
How much lunar theology have we around us, so that many from the cradle
to the grave get no clear sight of nature or of themselves! Very
closely did Carlyle come to the fable of Glam when speaking of
Coleridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;prophetic moonshine,&rsquo; and its effect on
poor John Sterling. &lsquo;If the bottled moonshine <i>be</i>actually
substance? Ah, could one but believe in a church while finding it
incredible!&hellip; The bereaved young lady <i>has</i> taken the veil
then!&hellip; To such lengths can transcendental moonshine, cast by
some morbidly radiating Coleridge into the chaos of a fermenting life,
act magically there, and produce divulsions and convulsions and
diseased developments.&rsquo; One can almost fancy Carlyle had ringing
in his memory the old Scottish ballad of the Rev. Robert Kirk,
translator of the Psalms into Gaelic, who, while walking in his
night-gown at Aberfoyle, was &lsquo;snatched away to the joyless Elfin
bower.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">The item of the night-gown might have already prepared

<p>A story is told of a man wandering on a dark night over Dartmoor,
whose feet slipped over the edge of a pit. He caught the branch of a
tree suspended over the terrible chasm, but unable to regain the
ground, shrieked for help. None came, though he cried out till his
voice was gone; and there he remained dangling in agony until the grey
light revealed that his feet were only a few inches from the solid
ground. Such are the chief demons that bind man till cockcrow. Such are
the apprehensions that waste also the moral and intellectual strength
of man, and murder his peace as he regards the necessary science of his
time to be cutting some frail tenure sustaining him over a bottomless
pit, instead of a release from real terror to the solid

answered&mdash;&lsquo;I am Plague: I have come from yon city where ten

between the plague and fear; for it is hardly doubtful that epidemics
retain their power in the East largely because they have gained
personification through fear as demons whose fatal power man can
neither prevent nor cure, before which he can only cower and pray.</p>
<p>In the missionary school at Canterbury the young men prepare

forth with materia medica in one hand, and in the other an infallible

or the destroying angel, or Satan, and the healing of disease the

<p>The demonisation of diseases is not wonderful. To thoughtful minds
not even science has dispelled the mystery which surrounds many of the
ailments that afflict mankind, especially the normal diseases besetting
children, hereditary complaints, and the strange liabilities to
infection and contagion. A genuine, however partial, observation would
suggest to primitive man some connection between the symptoms of many
diseases and the mysterious universe of which he could not yet
recognise himself an epitome. There were indications that certain
troubles of this kind were related to the seasons, consequently to the
celestial rulers of the seasons,&mdash;to the sun that smote by day,
and the moon at night. Professor Monier Williams, describing the
Devil-dances of Southern India, says that there seems to be an idea
among them that when pestilences are rife exceptional measures must be
taken to draw off the malignant spirits, supposed to cause them, by
tempting them to enter into these wild dancers, and so become
dissipated. He witnessed in Ceylon a dance performed by three men who
personated the forms and phases of typhus fever.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4571src" href="#xd26e4571" name="xd26e4571src">2</a> These dances
probably belong to the same class of ideas as those of the dervishes in
Persia, whose manifold contortions are supposed to repeat the movements
of planets. They are invocations of the souls of good stars, and
propitiations of such as are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>evil. Belief in such stellar and
planetary influences has pervaded every part of the world, and gave
rise to astrological dances. &lsquo;Gebelin says that the minuet was
the <i>danse oblique</i> of the ancient priests of Apollo, performed in
their temples. The diagonal line and the two parallels described in
this dance were intended to be symbolical of the zodiac, and the twelve
steps of which it is composed were meant for the twelve signs and the
months of the year. The dance round the Maypole and the Cotillon has
the same origin. Diodorus tells us that Apollo was adored with dances,
and in the island of Iona the god danced all night. The Christians of
St. Thomas till a very late day celebrated their worship with dances
and songs. Calmet says there were dancing-girls in the temple at
Jerusalem.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4579src" href="#xd26e4579"

<p>The influence of the Moon upon tides, the sleeplessness it causes,
the restlessness of the insane under its occasional light, and such
treacheries of moonshine as we have already considered, have populated
our uninhabited satellite with demons. Lunar legends have decorated
some well-founded suspicions of moonlight. The mother draws the curtain
between the moonshine and her little Endymion, though not because she
sees in the waning moon a pining Selene whose kiss may waste away the
beauty of youth. A mere survival is the &lsquo;bowing to the new
moon:&rsquo; a euphonism traceable to many myths about
&lsquo;lunacy,&rsquo; among them, as I think, to Delilah
(&lsquo;languishing&rsquo;), in whose lap the solar Samson is shorn of
his locks, leaving him only the blind destructive strength of the
&lsquo;moonstruck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the purely Semitic theories of the Jews we find diseases ascribed
to the wrath of Jehovah, and their cure to his merciful mood.
&lsquo;Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span>and
the plagues of thy seed; &hellip; he will bring upon thee all the
diseases of Egypt whereof thou wast afraid.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4588src" href="#xd26e4588" name="xd26e4588src">4</a> The
emerods which smote the worshippers of Dagon were ascribed directly to
the hand of Jehovah.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4593src" href=
"#xd26e4593" name="xd26e4593src">5</a> In that vague degree of natural
dualistic development which preceded the full Iranian influence upon
the Jews, the infliction of diseases was delegated to an angel of
Jehovah, as in the narratives of smiting the firstborn of Egypt,
wasting the army of Sennacherib, and the pestilence sent upon Israel
for David&rsquo;s sin. In the progress of this angel to be a demon of
disease we find a phase of ambiguity, as shown in the hypochondria of
Saul. &lsquo;The spirit of Jehovah departed from Saul, and an evil
spirit from Jehovah troubled him.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4598src" href="#xd26e4598" name="xd26e4598src">6</a></p>
<p>All such ambiguities disappeared under the influence of Iranian
dualism. In the Book of Job we find the infliction of diseases and
plagues completely transferred to a powerful spirit, a fully formed
opposing potentate. The &lsquo;sons of God,&rsquo; who in the first
chapter of Job are said to have presented themselves before Jehovah,
may be identified in the thirty-eighth as the stars which shouted for
joy at the creation. Satan is the wandering or malign planet which
leads in the Ahrimanic side of the Persian planisphere. In the
cosmographical theology of that country Ormuzd was to reign for six
thousand years, and then Ahriman was to reign for a similar period. The
moral associations of this speculation are discussed elsewhere; it is
necessary here only to point out the bearing of the planispheric
conception upon the ills that flesh is heir to. Ahriman is the
&lsquo;star-serpent&rsquo; of the Zendavasta. &lsquo;When the
p&acirc;ris rendered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253"
name="pb253">253</a>]</span>this world desolate, and overran the
universe; when the star-serpent made a path for himself between heaven
and earth,&rsquo; &amp;c.; &lsquo;when Ahriman rambles on the earth,
let him who takes the form of a serpent glide on the earth; let him who
takes the form of the wolf run on the earth, and let the violent north
wind bring weakness.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4610src" href=
"#xd26e4610" name="xd26e4610src">7</a></p>
<p>The dawn of Ormuzd corresponds with April. The sun returns from
winter&rsquo;s death by sign of the lamb (our Aries), and thenceforth
every month corresponds with a thousand years of the reign of the
Beneficent. September is denoted by the Virgin and Child. To the dark
domain of Ahriman the prefecture of the universe passes by
Libra,&mdash;the same balances which appear in the hand of Satan. The
star-serpent prevails over the Virgin and Child. Then follow the months
of the scorpion, the centaur, goat, &amp;c., every month corresponding
to a thousand years of the reign of Ahriman.</p>
<p>While this scheme corresponds in one direction with the demons of
cold, and in another with the entrance and reign of moral evil in the
world, beginnings of disease on earth were also ascribed to this
seventh thousand of years when the Golden Age had passed. The depth of
winter is reached in domicile of the goat, or of Sirius, Seth, Saturn,
Satan&mdash;according to the many variants. And these, under their
several names, make the great &lsquo;infortune&rsquo; of astrology,
wherein old Culpepper amply instructed our fathers. &lsquo;In the
general, consider that <i>Saturn</i> is an old worn-out planet, weary,
and of little estimation in this world; he causeth long and tedious
sicknesses, abundance of sadness, and a Cartload of doubts and fears;
his nature is cold, and dry, and melancholy. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>And
take special notice of this, that when Saturn is Lord of an Eclipse (as
he is one of the Lords of this), he governs all the rest of the
planets, but none can govern him. <i>Melancholy is made of all the
humors in the body of man, but no humor of melancholy.</i> He is
envious, and keeps his anger long, and speaks but few words, but when
he speaks he speaks to purpose. A man of deep cogitations; he will plot
mischief when men are asleep; he hath an admirable memory, and
remembers to this day how <i>William</i> the Bastard abused him; he
cannot endure to be a slave; he is poor with the poor, fearful with the
fearful; he plots mischief against the Superiours, with them that plot
mischief against them; have a care of him, <span class=
"sc">Kings</span> and <span class="sc">Magistrates</span> of Europe; he
will show you what he can do in the effects of this Eclipse; he is old,
and therefore hath large experience, and will give perilous counsel; he
moves but slowly, and therefore doth the more mischief; all the planets
contribute their natures and strength to him, and when he sets on doing
mischief he will do it to purpose; he doth not regard the company of
the rest of the Planets, neither do any of the rest of the Planets
regard his; he is a barren Planet, and therefore delights not in women;
he brings the Pestilence; he is destructive to the fruits of the earth;
he receives his light from the Sun, and yet he hates the Sun that gives
it him.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4638src" href="#xd26e4638"
name="xd26e4638src">8</a></p>
<p>Many ages anterior to this began in India the dread of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>Ketu, astronomically the ninth planet,
mythologically the tail of the demon Rahu, cut in twain as already told
(p. 46), supposed to be the prolific source of comets, meteors, and
falling stars, also of diseases. From this Ketu or dragon&rsquo;s tail
were born the Arunah Ketavah (Red Ketus or apparitions), and Ketu has
become almost another word for disease.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>Strongly influenced as were the Jews by the exact division of the
duodecimal period between Good and Evil, affirmed by the Persians, they
never lost sight of the ultimate supremacy of Jehovah. Though Satan had
gradually become a voluntary genius of evil, he still had to receive
permission to afflict, as in the case of Job, and during the lifetime
of Paul appears to have been still denied that &lsquo;power of
death&rsquo; which is first asserted by the unknown author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4668src" href=
"#xd26e4668" name="xd26e4668src">10</a> Satan&rsquo;s especial office
was regarded as the infliction of disease. Paul delivers the incestuous
Corinthian to Satan &lsquo;for the destruction of the flesh,&rsquo; and
he also attributed the sickness and death of many to their
communicating unworthily.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4672src" href=
"#xd26e4672" name="xd26e4672src">11</a> He also recognises his own

<p>A penitential Psalm (Assyrian) reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>O my Lord! my sins are many, my trespasses are great; and the wrath
of the gods has plagued me with disease, and with sickness and
sorrow.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">I fainted, but no one stretched forth his hand!</p>

</div>
<p class="first">This Psalm would hardly be out of place in the English
burial-service, which deplores death as a visitation of divine wrath.
Wherever such an idea prevails, the natural outcome of it is a belief
in demons of disease. In ancient Egypt&mdash;following the belief in Ra
the Sun, from whose eyes all pleasing things proceeded, and Set, from
whose eyes came all noxious things,&mdash;from the baleful light of
Set&rsquo;s eyes were born the Seven Hathors, or Fates, whose names are
recorded in the Book of the Dead. Mr. Fox Talbot has translated
&lsquo;the Song of the Seven Spirits:&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">They are seven! they are seven!</p>

<p class="line">Male they are not: female they are not!</p>

<p class="first">These demons have a way of herding together; the

Gen. xvi. 1</a>. But the fatal Seven turn to the seven fruits that
charm away evil influences at parturition in Persia, also the Seven
Wise Women of the same country traditionally present on holy occasions.
When Ard&aacute; Vir&aacute;f was sent to Paradise by a sacred narcotic
to obtain intelligence of the true faith, seven fires were kept burning
for seven days around him, and the seven wise women chanted hymns of
the Avesta.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4767src" href="#xd26e4767" name=
"xd26e4767src">15</a></p>
<p>The entrance of the seven evil powers into a dwelling was believed
by the Assyrians to be preventible by setting in the doorway small
images, such as those of the sun-god (Hea) and the moon-goddess, but
especially of Marduk, corresponding to Serapis the Egyptian Esculapius.
These powers were reinforced by writing holy texts over and on each
side of the threshold. &lsquo;In the night time bind around the sick
man&rsquo;s head a sentence taken from a good book.&rsquo; The
phylacteries of the Jews were originally worn for the same purpose.
They were called Tefila, and were related to <i>teraphim,</i> the
little idols<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4775src" href="#xd26e4775"
name="xd26e4775src">16</a> used by the Jews to keep out
demons&mdash;such as those of Laban, which his daughter Rachel
stole.</p>
<p>The resemblance of teraphim to the Tarasca (connected by some with
G. <span class="trans" title="teras"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&tau;&#8051;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span></span>, a monster) of
Spain may be noted,&mdash;the serpent figures carried about in Corpus
Christi processions. The latter word is known in the south of France
also, and gave its name to the town Tarascon. The legend is that an
amphibious monster haunted the Rhone, preventing navigation and
committing terrible ravages, until sixteen of the boldest inhabitants
of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>district resolved to encounter it. Eight lost
their lives, but the others, having destroyed the monster, founded the
town of Tarascon, where the &lsquo;<span lang="fr">F&ecirc;te de la
tarasque</span>&rsquo; is still kept up.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4797src" href="#xd26e4797" name="xd26e4797src">17</a> Calmet,
Sedley, and others, however, believe that <i>teraphim</i> is merely a
modification of seraphim, and the Tefila, or phylacteries, of the same
origin.</p>
<p>The phylactery was tied into a knot. Justin Martyr says that the
Jewish exorcists used &lsquo;magic ties or knots.&rsquo; The origin of
this custom among the Jews and Babylonians may be found in the Assyrian
Talismans preserved in the British Museum, of which the following has
been translated by Mr. Fox Talbot:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="first">The number seven holds an equally high degree of
potency in Singhalese demonolatry, which is mainly occupied with
diseases. The Capuas or conjurors of that island enumerate 240,000
magic spells, of which all except one are for evil, which implies a
tolerably large preponderance of the emergencies in which their
countervailing efforts are required by their neighbours. That of course
can be easily appreciated by those who have been taught that all human
beings are included under a primal curse. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>The words of Micah,
&lsquo;Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the
sea,&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4841src" href="#xd26e4841" name=
"xd26e4841src">19</a> are recalled by the legend of these evil spells
of Ceylon. The king of Oude came to marry one of seven princesses, all
possessing pr&aelig;ternatural powers, and questioned each as to her
art. Each declared her skill in doing harm, except one who asserted her
power to heal all ills which the others could inflict. The king having
chosen this one as his bride, the rest were angry, and for revenge
collected all the charms in the world, enclosed them in a
pumpkin&mdash;the only thing that can contain spells without being
reduced to ashes&mdash;and sent this infernal machine to their sister.
It would consume everything for sixteen hundred miles round; but the
messenger dropped it in the sea. A god picked it up and presented it to
the King of Ceylon, and these, with the healing charm known to his own
Queen, make the 240,000 spells known to the Capuas of that island, who
have no doubt deified the rescuer of the spells on the same principle
that inspires some seaside populations to worship Providence more
devoutly on the Sunday after a valuable wreck in their
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The astrological origin of the evils ascribed to the Yakseyo
(Demons) of Ceylon, and the horoscope which is a necessary preliminary
to any dealing with their influences; the constant recurrence of the
number seven, denoting origin with races holding the seven-planet
theories of the universe; and the fact that all demons are said, on
every Saturday evening, to attend an assemblage called <i>Yaksa
Sabawa</i> (Witches&rsquo; Sabbath), are facts that may well engage the
attention of Comparative Mythologists.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4851src" href="#xd26e4851" name="xd26e4851src">20</a> In
Dardistan the evil spirits are called <i>Yatsh</i>; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>they
dwell &lsquo;in the regions of snow,&rsquo; and the overthrow of their
reign over the country is celebrated at the new moon of Daykio, the
month preceding winter.</p>
<p>The largest proportion of the Disease Demons of Ceylon are descended
from its Hunger Demons. The Preta there is much the same phantom as in
Siam, only they are not quite so tall.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4866src" href="#xd26e4866" name="xd26e4866src">21</a> They range
from two to four hundred feet in height, and are so numerous that a
Pali Buddhist book exhorts people not to throw stones, lest they should
harm one of these harmless starveling ghosts, who die many times of
hunger, and revive to suffer on in expiation of their sins in a
previous existence. They are harmless in one sense, but filthy; and bad
smells are personified in them. The great mass of demons resemble the
Pretraya, in that their king (Wessamony) has forbidden them to satisfy
themselves directly upon their victims, but by inflicting diseases they
are supposed to receive an imaginative satisfaction somewhat like that
of eating people.</p>
<p>Reeri is the Demon of Blood-disease. His form is that of a man with
face of a monkey; he is fiery red, rides on a red bull, and all
hemorrhages and diseases of the blood are attributed to him. Reeri has
eighteen different disguises or avatars. One of these recalls his
earlier position as a demon of death, before Vishnu revealed to Capuas
the means of binding him: he is now supposed to be present at every
death-bed in the form of a delighted pigmy, one span and six inches
high. On such occasions he bears a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261"
href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>cock in one hand, a club in
the other, and in his mouth a corpse. In the same country Maha Sohon is
the &lsquo;great graveyard demon.&rsquo; He resides in a hill where he
is supposed to surround himself with carcases. He is 122 feet high, has
four hands and three eyes, and a red skin. He has the head of a bear;
the legend being that while quarrelling with another giant his head was
knocked off, and the god Senasura was gracious enough to tear off the
head of a bear and clap it on the decapitated giant. His capua
threatens him with a repetition of this catastrophe if he does not
spare any threatened victim who has called in his priestly aid. Except
for this timidity about his head, Maha is formidable, being chief of
30,000 demons. But curiously enough he is said to choose for his steeds
the more innocent animals,&mdash;goat, deer, horse, elephant, and
hog.</p>
<p>One of the demons most dreaded in Ceylon is the &lsquo;Foreign
Demon&rsquo; Morotoo, said to have come from the coast of Malabar, and
from his residence in a tree disseminated diseases which could not be
cured until, the queen being afflicted, one capua was found able to
master him. Seven-eighths of the charms used in restraining the
disease-demons of Ceylon, of which I have mentioned but a few, are in
the Tamil tongue. In various parts of India are found very nearly the
same systematic demonolatry and &lsquo;devil-dancing;&rsquo; for
example in Travancore, to whose superstitions of this character the
Rev. Samuel Mateer has devoted two chapters in his work &lsquo;The Land
of Charity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The great demon of diseases in Ceylon is entitled Maha Cola Sanni
Yakseya. His father, a king, ordered his queen to be put to death in
the belief that she had been faithless to him. Her body was to be cut
in two pieces, one of which was to be hung upon a tree
(<i>Ukberiya</i>), the other to be thrown at its foot to the dogs. The
queen before her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262"
name="pb262">262</a>]</span>execution said, &lsquo;If this charge be
false, may the child in my womb be born this instant a demon, and may
that demon destroy the whole of this city and its unjust king.&rsquo;
So soon as the executioners had finished their work, the two severed
parts of the queen&rsquo;s body reunited, a child was born who
completely devoured his mother, and then repaired to the graveyard
(Sohon), where for a time he fattened on corpses. Then he proceeded to
inflict mortal diseases upon the city, and had nearly depopulated it
when the gods Iswara and Sekkra interfered, descending to subdue him in
the disguise of mendicants. Possibly the great Maha Sohon mentioned
above, and the Sohon (graveyard) from which Sanni dealt out deadliness,
may be best understood by the statement of the learned writer from whom
these facts are quoted, that, &lsquo;excepting the Buddhist priests,
and the aristocrats of the land, whose bodies were burnt in regular
funeral-piles after death, the corpses of the rest of the people were
neither burned nor buried, but thrown into a place called
<i>Sohona</i>, which was an open piece of ground in the jungle,
generally a hollow among the hills, at the distance of three or four
miles from any inhabited place, where they were left in the open air to
be decomposed or devoured by dogs and wild beasts.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4885src" href="#xd26e4885" name=
"xd26e4885src">22</a> There would appear to be even more ground for the
dread of the Great Graveyard Demon in many parts of Christendom, where,
through desire to preserve corpses for a happy resurrection, they are
made to steal through the water-veins of the earth, and find their
resurrection as fell diseases. Iswara and Sekkra were probably two
reformers who persuaded the citizens to bury the poor deep in the
earth; had they been wise enough to place the dead where nature would
give them speedy resurrection and life in grass and flowers, it would
not have been further recorded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263"
href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>that &lsquo;they ordered him
(the demon) to abstain from eating men, but gave him Wurrun or
permission to inflict disease on mankind, and to obtain
offerings.&rsquo; This is very much the same as the privilege given our
Western funeral agencies and cemeteries also; and when the Modliar adds
that Sanni &lsquo;has eighteen principal attendants,&rsquo; one can
hardly help thinking of the mummers, gravediggers, chaplains, all
engaged unconsciously in the work of making the earth less
habitable.</p>
<p>The first of the attendants of this formidable avenger of his
mother&rsquo;s wrongs is named Bhoota Sanni Yakseya, Demon of Madness.
The whole demonolatry and devil-dancing of that island are so insane
that one is not surprised that this Bhoota had but little special
development. It is amid clear senses we might naturally look for full
horror of madness, and there indeed do we find it. One of the most
horrible forms of the disease-demon was the personification of madness
among the Greeks, as Mania.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4892src" href=
"#xd26e4892" name="xd26e4892src">23</a> In the <i>Hercules Furens</i>
of Euripides, where Madness, &lsquo;the unwedded daughter of black
Night,&rsquo; and sprung of &lsquo;the blood of C&oelig;lus,&rsquo; is
evoked from Tartarus for the express purpose of imbreeding in Hercules
&lsquo;child-slaying disturbances of reason,&rsquo; there is a
suggestion of the hereditary nature of insanity. Obedient to the
vindictive order of Juno, &lsquo;in her chariot hath gone forth the
marble-visaged, all-mournful Madness, the Gorgon of Night, and with the
hissing of hundred heads of snakes, she gives the goad to her chariot,
on mischief bent.&rsquo; We may plainly see that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=

ending in madness. Already ancient were the words <span class="trans"

and <span class="trans" title="manik&#275;"><span class="Greek" lang=

Plato cited their identity to prove one kind of madness the special
gift of Heaven:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4923src" href="#xd26e4923"
name="xd26e4923src">24</a> the notion lingers in Dryden&rsquo;s line,
&lsquo;Great wits to madness sure are near allied;&rsquo; and survive
in regions where deference is paid to lunatics and idiots. Other
diseases preserve in their names indications of similar association:
<i>e.g.</i>, Nympholepsy, St. Vitus&rsquo;s Dance, St. Anthony&rsquo;s
Fire. Wesley attributes still epilepsy to &lsquo;possession.&rsquo;
This was in pursuance of ancient beliefs. Typhus, a name anciently
given to every malady accompanied with stupor (<span class="trans"
title="typhos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&tau;&#8166;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>), seemed the
breath of feverish Typhon. Max M&uuml;ller connects the word
<i>quinsy</i> with Sanskrit <i>amh</i>, &lsquo;to throttle,&rsquo; and
Ahi the throttling serpent, its medium being <i>angina</i>; and this
again is <span class="trans" title="kynanch&#275;"><span class="Greek"
lang="grc">&kappa;&upsilon;&nu;&#8049;&gamma;&chi;&eta;</span></span>,
dog-throttling, the Greek for quinsy.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The genius of William Blake, steeped in Hebraism, never showed
greater power than in his picture of Plague. A gigantic hideous form,
pale-green, with the slime of stagnant pools, reeking with vegetable
decays and gangrene, the face livid with the motley tints of pallor and
putrescence, strides onward with extended arms like a sower sowing his
seeds, only in this case the germs of his horrible harvest are not cast
from the hands, but emanate from the fingers as being of their essence.
Such, to the savage mind, was the embodiment of malaria, sultriness,
rottenness, the putrid Pretraya, invisible, but smelt and felt. Such,
to the ignorant imagination, is the Destroying Angel to which
rationalistic artists and poets have tried to add wings and majesty;
but which in the popular mind was no doubt pictured more like this form
found at Ostia <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>(<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>), and now passing
in the Vatican for a Satan,&mdash;probably a demon of the Pontine
Marshes, and of the fever that still has victims of its fatal cup (p.
291). In these fearful forms the poor savage believed with such an
intensity that he was able to shape the brain of man to his phantasy;
bringing about the anomaly that the great reformer, Luther, should
affirm, even while fighting superstition, that a Christian ought to
know that he lives in the midst of devils, and that the devil is nearer
to him than his coat or his shirt. The devils, he tells us, are all
around us, and are at every moment seeking to ensnare our lives,
salvation, and happiness. There are many of them in the woods, waters,
deserts, and in damp muddy places, for the purpose of doing folk a
mischief. They also house in the dense black clouds, and send storms,
hail, thunder and lightning, and poison the air with their infernal
stench. In one place, Luther tells us that the devil has more vessels
and boxes full of poison, with which he kills people, than all the
apothecaries in the whole world. He sends all plagues and diseases
among men. We may be sure that when any one dies of the pestilence, is
drowned, or drops suddenly dead, the devil does it.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of Zoology, the primitive man easily falls into the
belief that his cattle&mdash;the means of life&mdash;may be the
subjects of sorcery. Jesus sending devils into a herd of swine may have
become by artificial process a divine benefactor in the eye of
Christendom, but the myth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>makes Him bear an exact
resemblance to the dangerous sorcerer that fills the savage mind with
dread. It is probable that the covetous eye denounced in the decalogue
means the evil eye, which was supposed to blight an object intensely
desired but not to be obtained.</p>
<p>Gopolu, already referred to (p. 136) as the Singhalese demon of
hydrophobia, bears the general name of the &lsquo;Cattle Demon.&rsquo;
He is said to have been the twin of the demigod Mangara by a queen on
the Coromandel coast. The mother died, and a cow suckled the twins, but
afterwards they quarrelled, and Gopolu being slain was transformed into
a demon. He repaired to Arangodde, and fixed his abode in a Banyan
where there is a large bee-hive, whence proceed many evils. The
population around this Banyan for many miles being prostrated by
diseases, the demigod Mangara and Pattini (goddess of chastity)
admonished the villagers to sacrifice a cow regularly, and thus they
were all resuscitated. Gopolu now sends all cattle diseases. India is
full of the like superstitions. The people of Travancore especially
dread the demon Madan, &lsquo;he who is like a cow,&rsquo; believed to
strike oxen with sudden illness,&mdash;sometimes men also.</p>
<p>In Russia we find superstition sometimes modified by common sense.
Though the peasant hopes that Zegory (St. George) will defend his
cattle, he begins to see the chief foes of his cattle. As in the
folk-song&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">We have gone around the field,</p>
<p class="line">We have called Zegory&#8202;&hellip;.</p>
<p class="line">O thou, our brave Zegory,</p>

<p class="line">In the forest and beyond the forest,</p>

<p class="first">Nevertheless when a cattle plague occurs many villages
relapse into a normally extinct state of mind. Thus, a few years ago,
in a village near Moscow, all the women, having warned the men away,
stripped themselves entirely naked and drew a plough so as to make a
furrow entirely around the village. At the point of juncture in this
circle they buried alive a cock, a cat, and a dog. Then they filled the
air with lamentations, crying&mdash;&lsquo;Cattle Plague! Cattle
Plague! spare our cattle! Behold, we offer thee cock, cat, and
dog!&rsquo; The dog is a demonic character in Russia, while the cat is
sacred; for once when the devil tried to get into Paradise in the form
of a mouse, the dog allowed him to pass, but the cat pounced on
him&mdash;the two animals being set on guard at the door. The offering
of both seems to represent a desire to conciliate both sides. The
nudity of the women may have been to represent to the hungry gods their
utter poverty, and inability to give more; but it was told me in
Moscow, where I happened to be staying at the time, that it would be
dangerous for any man to draw near during the performance.</p>
<p>In Altmark<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5018src" href="#xd26e5018"
name="xd26e5018src">27</a> the demons who bewitch cattle are called
&lsquo;Bihlweisen,&rsquo; and are believed to bury certain diabolical
charms under thresholds over which the animals are to pass, causing
them to wither away, the milk to cease, etc. The prevention is to wash
the cattle with a lotion of sea cabbage boiled with infusion of wine.
In the same province it is related that once there appeared in a
harvest-field at one time fifteen, at another twelve men (apparently),
the latter headless. They all laboured with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>scythes, but though the rustling could be heard
no grain fell. When questioned they said nothing, and when the people
tried to seize them they ran away, cutting fruitlessly as they ran. The
priests found in this a presage of the coming cattle plague. The
Russian superstition of the plough, above mentioned, is found in
fragmentary survivals in Altmark. Thus, it is said that to plough
around a village and then sit under the plough (placed upright), will
enable any one to see the witches; and in some villages, some bit of a
plough is hung up over a doorway through which cattle pass, as no devil
can then approach them. The demons have a natural horror of honest
work, and especially the culture of the earth. Goethe, as we have seen,
notes their fear of roses: perhaps he remembered the legend of Aspasia,
who, being disfigured by a tumour on the chin, was warned by a
dove-maiden to dismiss her physicians and try a rose from the garland
of Venus; so she recovered health and beauty. <span class=

prescription by St. James of prayer and holy anointing for the sick
only after medical aid&mdash;of which Asa died when he preferred it to
the Lord&mdash;has failed; <i>i.e.</i> extreme unction. Castelar
remarks that the Conclave which elected Pius IX. sat in the Quirinal
rather than the Vatican, &lsquo;because, while it hoped for the
inspirations of the Holy Spirit in every place, it feared that in the
palace <i>par excellence</i> divine inspirations would not sufficiently
counteract the effluvias of the fever.&rsquo; The legal prosecutions of
the &lsquo;Peculiar People&rsquo; for obeying the New Testament command
in case of sickness supply a notable example of the equal hypocrisy of
the protestant age. England has distributed the Bible as a divine
revelation in 150 different languages; and in London it punishes a sect
for obedience to one of its plainest directions.&nbsp;<a class=

this sanctity of the number seven it may be remarked that it has spread
through the world with Christianity,&mdash;seven churches, seven gifts
of the Spirit, seven sins and virtues. It is easy therefore to mistake
orthodox doctrines for survivals. In the London &lsquo;Times&rsquo; of
June 24, 1875, there was reported an inquest at Corsham, Wiltshire, on
the body of Miriam Woodham, who died under the prescriptions of William
Bigwood, herbalist. It was shown that he used pills made of seven
herbs. This was only shown to be a &lsquo;pagan survival<span class=

<p class="first">Savage races believe that no man dies except by
sorcery. Therefore every death must be avenged. The Actas of the
Philippines regard the &lsquo;Indians&rsquo; as the cause of the deaths
among them; and when one of them loses a relative, he lurks and watches
until he has spied an &lsquo;Indian&rsquo; and killed him.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5036src" href="#xd26e5036" name="xd26e5036src">1</a>
It is a progress from this when primitive man advances to the belief
that the fatal sorcerer is an invisible man&mdash;a demon. When this
doctrine is taught in the form of a belief that death entered the world
through the machinations of Satan, and was not in the original scheme
of creation, it is civilised; but when it is inculcated under a set of
African or other non-christian names, it is barbarian.</p>
<p>The following sketch, by Mr. Gideon Lang, will show the intensity of
this conviction among the natives of New South Wales:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;While at Nanima I constantly saw one of these, named Jemmy, a
remarkably fine man, about twenty-eight years <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>of
age, who was the &lsquo;model Christian&rsquo; of the missionaries, and
who had been over and over again described in their reports as a living
proof that, taken in infancy, the natives were as capable of being
truly christianised as a people who had had eighteen centuries of
civilisation. I confess that I strongly doubted, but still there was no
disputing the apparent facts. Jemmy was not only familiar with the
Bible, which he could read remarkably well, but he was even better
acquainted with the more abstruse tenets of christianity; and so far as
the whites could see, his behaviour was in accordance with his
religious acquirements. One Sunday morning I walked down to the black
fellows&rsquo; camp, to have a talk with Jemmy, as usual. I found him
sitting in his gunyah, overlooking a valley of the Macquarrie, whose
waters glanced brightly in the sunshine of the delicious spring
morning. He was sitting in a state of nudity, excepting his waistcloth,
very earnestly reading the Bible, which indeed was his constant
practice; and I could see that he was perusing the Sermon on the Mount.
I seated myself, and waited till he concluded the chapter, when he laid
down the Bible, folded his hands, and sat with his eyes fixed
abstractedly on his fire. I bade him &lsquo;good morning,&rsquo; which
he <span class="corr" id="xd26e5045" title=
"Source: acknowleged">acknowledged</span> without looking up. I then
said, &lsquo;Jemmy, what is the meaning of your spears being stuck in a
circle round you?&rsquo; He looked me steadily in the eyes, and said
solemnly and with suppressed fierceness, &lsquo;Mother&rsquo;s
dead!&rsquo; I said that I was very sorry to hear it; &lsquo;but what
had her death to do with the spears being stuck around so?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Bogan black-fellow killed her!&rsquo; was the fierce and gloomy
reply. &lsquo;Killed by a Bogan black!&rsquo; I exclaimed: &lsquo;why,
your mother has been dying a fortnight, and Dr. Curtis did not expect
her to outlive last night, which you know as well as I do.&rsquo; His
only reply was a dogged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>repetition of the words: &lsquo;A
Bogan black-fellow killed her!&rsquo; I appealed to him as a
Christian&mdash;to the Sermon on the Mount, that he had just been
reading; but he absolutely refused to promise that he would not avenge
his mother&rsquo;s death. In the afternoon of that day we were startled
by a yell which can never be mistaken by any person who has once heard
the wild war-whoop of the blacks when in battle array. On marching out
we saw all the black fellows of the neighbourhood formed into a line,
and following Jemmy in an imaginary attack upon an enemy. Jemmy himself
disappeared that evening. On the following Wednesday morning I found
him sitting complacently in his gunyah, plaiting a rope of human hair,
which I at once knew to be that of his victim. Neither of us spoke; I
stood for some time watching him as he worked with a look of mocking
defiance of the anger he knew I felt. I pointed to a hole in the middle
of his fire, and said, &lsquo;Jemmy, the proper place for your Bible is
there.&rsquo; He looked up with his eyes flashing as I turned away, and
I never saw him again. I afterwards learned that he had gone to the
district of the Bogan tribe, where the first black he met happened to
be an old friend and companion of his own. This man had just made the
first cut in the bark of a tree, which he was about to climb for an
opossum; but on hearing footsteps he leaped down and faced round, as
all blacks do, and whites also, when blacks are in question. Seeing
that it was only Jemmy, however, he resumed his occupation, but had no
sooner set to work than Jemmy sent a spear through his back and nailed
him to the tree.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5050src" href="#xd26e5050"
name="xd26e5050src">2</a></p>
<p>Perhaps if Jemmy could have been cross-examined by the
non-missionary mind, he might have replied with some effect to Mr.
Lang&rsquo;s suggestion that he ought to part with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>his
Bible. Surely he must have found in that volume a sufficient number of
instances to justify his faith in the power of demons over human health
and life. Might he not have pondered the command, &lsquo;thou shalt not
suffer a witch to live,&rsquo; and imagined that he was impaling
another Manasseh, who &lsquo;used enchantments, and used witchcraft,
and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards (and) wrought much
evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke Him to anger.&rsquo;<a class=

Those who hope that the Bible may carry light into the dark places of
superstition and habitations of cruelty might, one would say, reflect
upon the long contest which European science had with bibliolators in
trying to relieve the popular mind from the terrors of witchcraft,
whose genuineness it was (justly) declared contrary to the Scriptures
to deny. There are districts in Great Britain and America, and many
more on the continent of Europe, where the spells that waste and
destroy are still believed in; where effigies of wax or even onions are
labelled with some hated name, and stuck over with pins, and set near
fires to be melted or dried up, in full belief that some subject of the
charm will be consumed by disease along with the object used. Under
every roof where such coarse superstitions dwell the Bible dwells
beside them, and experience proves that the infallibility of all such
talismans diminishes <i>pari passu</i>.</p>

<p>What the savage is really trying to slay when he goes forth to
avenge his relative&rsquo;s death on the first alien he finds may be
seen in the accompanying figure (<a href="#fig17">17</a>), which
represents the Mexican goddess of death&mdash;Teoyaomiqui. The image is
nine feet high, and is kept in a museum in the city of Mexico. Mr.
Edward B. Tylor, from whose excellent book of travels in that country
the figure is copied, says of it:&mdash;&lsquo;The stone known as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>the statue of the war-goddess is a huge block of
basalt covered with sculptures. The antiquaries think that the figures
on it stand for different personages, and that it is three
gods&mdash;Huitzilopochtli, the god of war; Teoyaomiqui, his wife; and
Mictlanteuctli, the god of hell. It has necklaces of alternate hearts
and dead men&rsquo;s hands, with death&rsquo;s heads for a central
ornament. At the bottom of the block is a strange sprawling figure,
which one cannot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274"
name="pb274">274</a>]</span>see now, for it is the base which rests on
the ground; but there are two shoulders projecting from the idol, which
show plainly that it did not stand on the ground, but was supported
aloft on the tops of two pillars. The figure carved upon the bottom
represents a monster holding a skull in each hand, while others hang
from his knees and elbows. His mouth is a mere oval ring, a common
feature of Mexican idols, and four tusks project just above it. The new
moon laid down like a bridge forms his forehead, and a star is placed
on each side of it. This is thought to have been the conventional
representation of Mictlanteuctli (Lord of the Land of the Dead), the
god of hell, which was a place of utter and <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5081" title="Source: eteranal">eternal</span> darkness. Probably
each victim as he was led to the altar could look up between the two
pillars and see the hideous god of hell staring down upon him from
above. There is little doubt that this is the famous war-idol which
stood on the great teocalli of Mexico, and before which so many
thousands of human beings were sacrificed. It lay undisturbed under
ground in the great square, close to the very site of the teocalli,
until sixty years ago. For many years after that it was kept buried,
lest the sight of one of their old deities might be too exciting for
the Indians, who, as I have mentioned before, had certainly not
forgotten it, and secretly ornamented it with garlands of flowers while
it remained above ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If my reader will now turn to the (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>)
portrait of the Demon of Serpents, he will find a conception
fundamentally similar to the Mexican demoness of death or slaughter,
but one that is not shut up in a museum of antiquities; it still haunts
and terrifies a vast number of the people born in Ceylon. He is the
principal demon invoked in Ceylon by the malignant sorcerers in
performing the 84,000 different charms that afflict evils
(<i>Hooniyan</i>). His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>general title is <span class=
"sc">Oddy Cumara Hooniyan Dewatawa</span>; but he has a special name
for each of his six several apparitions, the chief of these being Cali
Oddisey, or demon of incurable diseases, therefore of death, and Naga
Oddisey, demon of serpents&mdash;deadliest of animals. Beneath him is
the Pale Horse which has had its career so long and far,&mdash;even to
the White Mare on which, in some regions, Christ is believed to revisit
the earth every Christmas; and also the White Mare of Yorkshire
Folklore which bore its rider from Whitestone Cliff to hell. This
Singhalese form also, albeit now associated by Capuas with fatal
disease, was probably at first, like the Mexican, a war goddess and god
combined, as is shown by the uplifted sword, and reeking hand uplifted
in triumph. Equally a god of war is our &lsquo;Death on the Pale
Horse,&rsquo; which christian art, following the so-called Apocalypse,
has made so familiar. &lsquo;I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his
name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power
was given to him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword,
and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the
earth.&rsquo; This is but a travesty of the Greek Ares, the Roman Mars,
or god of War. In the original Greek-form Ares was not solely the god
of war, but of destruction generally. In the &OElig;dipus Tyrannus of
Sophocles we have the popular conception of him as one to whom the
deadly plague is ascribed. He is named as the &lsquo;god unhonoured
among gods,&rsquo; and it is said:&mdash;&lsquo;The city is wildly
tossing, and no more can lift up her head from the waves of death;
withering the ripening grain in the husks, withering the kine in their
pastures; blighted are the babes through the failing labours of women;
the fire-bearing god, horrid Pestilence, having darted down, ravages
the city; by him the house <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>of Cadmus is empty, and dark Hades
enriched with groans and lamentations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mother of the deadliest &lsquo;Calas&rsquo; of Singhalese
demonolatry, sister of the Scandinavian Hel in name and nature, is
Kali. Although the Hindu writers repudiate the idea that there is any
devil among their three hundred and thirty millions of deities, it is
difficult to deny Kali that distinction. Her wild dance of delight over
bodies of the slain would indicate pleasure taken in destruction for
its own sake, so fulfilling the definition of a devil; but, on the
other hand, there is a Deccan legend that reports her as devouring the
dead, and this would make her a hunger-demon. We may give her the
benefit of the doubt, and class her among the demons&mdash;or beings
whose evil is not gratuitous&mdash;all the more because the
mysteriously protruding tongue, as in the figure of Typhon (p. 185),
probably suggests thirst. Hindu legend does, indeed, give another
interpretation, and say that when she was dancing for joy at having
slain a hundred-headed giant demigod, the shaking of the earth was so
formidable that Siva threw himself among the slain, whom she was
crushing at every step, hoping to induce her to pause; but when,
unheeding, she trod upon the body of her husband, she paused and thrust
out her tongue from surprise and shame. The Vedic description of Agni
as an <i>ugra</i> (ogre), with &lsquo;tongue of flame,&rsquo; may
better interpret Kali&rsquo;s tongue. It is said Kali is pleased for a
hundred years by the blood of a tiger; for a thousand by that of a man;
for a hundred thousand by the blood of three men.</p>
<div class="figure fig18width" id="fig18"><img src="images/fig118.jpg"

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 18.&mdash;<span class="sc">Kali.</span></p>
</div>
<p>How are we to understand this dance of Death, and the further legend
of her tossing dead bodies into the air for amusement? Such a figure
found among a people who shudder at taking life even from the lowest
animals is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>hardly to be explained by the destructiveness of
nature personified in her spouse Siva. Her looks and legends
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>alike represent slaughter by human violence. May
it not be that Kali represents some period when the abhorrence of
taking life among a vegetarian people&mdash;a people, too, believing in
transmigration&mdash;might have become a public danger? When Krishna
appeared it was, according to the Bh&aacute;gavat Gita, as charioteer
inciting Arjoon to war. There must have been various periods when a
peaceful people must fall victims to more savage neighbours unless they
could be stimulated to enter on the work of destruction with a light
heart. There may have been periods when the human Kalis of India might
stimulate their husbands and sons to war with such songs as the women
of Dardistan sing at the Feast of Fire (p. 91). The amour of the Greek
goddess of Beauty with the god of War, leaving her lawful spouse the
Smith, is full of meaning. The Assyrian Venus, Istar, appeared in a
vision, with wings and halo, bearing a bow and arrow for Assurbanipal.
The Thug appears to have taken some such view of Kali, regarding her as
patroness of their plan for reducing population. They are said to have
claimed that Kali left them one of her teeth for a pickaxe, her rib for
a knife, her garment&rsquo;s hem for a noose, and wholesale murder for
a religion. The uplifted right hand of the demoness has been
interpreted as intimating a divine purpose in the havoc around her, and
it is possible that some such euphemism attached to the attitude before
the Thug accepted it as his own benediction from this highly decorated
personage of human cruelty.</p>
<p>The ancient reverence for Kali has gradually passed to her mitigated
form&mdash;Durg&aacute;. Around her too are visible the symbols of
destruction; but she is supposed to be satisfied with pumpkin-animals,
and the weapons in her ten hands are believed to be directed against
the enemies of the gods, especially against the giant king Muheshu. She
is mother of the beautiful boy Kartik, and of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>elephant-headed inspirer of knowledge Ganesa.
She is reverenced now as female energy, the bestower of beauty and
fruitfulness on women.</p>
<p>The identity of war-gods and death-demons, in the most frightful
conceptions which have haunted the human imagination, is of profound
significance. These forms do not represent peaceful and natural death,
not death by old age,&mdash;of which, alas, those who cowered before
them knew but little,&mdash;but death amid cruelty and agony, and the
cutting down of men in the vigour of life. That indeed was
terrible,&mdash;even more than these rude images could describe.</p>
<p>But there are other details in these hideous forms. The priest has
added to the horse and sword of war the adored serpent, and hideous
symbols of the &lsquo;Land of the Dead.&rsquo; For it is not by terror
of death, but of what he can persuade men lies beyond, that the priest
has reigned over mankind. When Isabel (in &lsquo;Measure for
Measure&rsquo;) is trying to persuade her brother that the sense of
death lies most in apprehension, the sentenced youth still finds death
&lsquo;a fearful thing.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="line">That flesh is heir to,&mdash;&rsquo;tis a

<p class="line">Devoutly to be wished.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The greater part of the human race still belong to
religions which, in their origin, promised eternal repose as the
supreme final bliss. Had death in itself possessed horrors for the
human mind, the priest need not have conjured up beyond it those
tortures that haunted Hamlet with the dreams of possible evils beyond
which make even the wretched rather bear the ills they have than fly to
others they know not of. It would have been sufficient sanction to
promise immortality only to the pious. But as in Claudio&rsquo;s
shuddering lines every hell is reflected&mdash;whether of ice, fire, or
brutalisation&mdash;so are the same mixed with the very blood and brain
of mankind, even where literally outgrown. Christianity superadded to
the horrors by importing the idea that death came by human sin, and so
by gradual development ascribing to Satan the power of death; thereby
forming a new devil who bore in him the power to make death a
punishment. How the matter stood in the medi&aelig;val belief may be
seen in figure 19, copied from a Russian Bible of the (early)
seventeenth century. Lazarus smiles to see the nondescript soul of
Dives torn from him by a devil with a hook, while another drowns the
groans with a drum. Satan squirts an infernal baptism on the departing
soul, and the earnest co-operation of the archangel justifies the
satisfaction of Lazarus and Abraham. This degraded belief is still
found in the almost gleeful pulpit-picturings of physical agonies as
especially attending the death-beds of &lsquo;infidels,&rsquo;&mdash;as
Voltaire and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>Paine,&mdash;and its fearful result is found in
the degree to which priesthoods are still able to paralyse the common
sense and heart of the masses by the barbaric ceremonials with which
they are permitted to surround death, and the arrogant line drawn
between unorthodox goats and credulous sheep by
&lsquo;consecrated&rsquo; ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Keary, in his interesting volume on &lsquo;The Dawn of
History,<span class="corr" id="xd26e5188" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5190src"
href="#xd26e5190" name="xd26e5190src">4</a> says that it has been
suggested that the youthful winged figure on the drum of a column from
the temple of Diana at Ephesus to the British Museum, may be a
representation of Thanatos, Death. It would be agreeable to believe
that the only important representation of Death left by Greek art is
that exquisite figure, whose high tribute is that it was at first
thought to be Love! The figure is somewhat like the tender Eros of
preraphaelite art, and with the same look of gentle melancholy. Such a
sweet and simple form of Death would be worthy of the race which, amid
all the fiery or cold rivers of the underworld which had gathered about
their religion, still saw running there the soft-flowing stream of
forgetfulness. Let one study this Ephesian Thanatos reverently&mdash;no
engraving or photograph can do it even partial justice&mdash;and then
in its light read those myths of Death which seem to bear us back
beyond the savagery of war and the artifices of priests to the simpler
conceptions of humanity. In its serene light we may especially read
both Vedic and Iranian hymns and legends of Yama.</p>
<p>The first man to die became the powerful Yama of the Hindus, the
monarch of the dead; and he became invested with metaphors of the sun
that had set.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5196src" href="#xd26e5196"
name="xd26e5196src">5</a> In a solemn and pathetic hymn of the Vedas he
is said to have crossed the rapid waters, to have shown the way to
many, to have first known the path on which our fathers crossed
over.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5201src" href="#xd26e5201" name=
"xd26e5201src">6</a> But in the splendours of sunset human hope found
its prophetic pictures of a heaven beyond. The Vedic Yama is ever the
friend. It is one of the most picturesque facts of mythology that,
after Yama had become in India another <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>name for Death, the
same name reappeared in Persia, and in the <i>Avesta</i>, as a type at
once of the Golden Age in the past and of paradise in the future.</p>
<p>Such was the Iranian Yima. He was that &lsquo;<span lang="la">flos
regum</span>&rsquo; whose reign represented &lsquo;the ideal of human
happiness, when there was neither illness nor death, neither heat nor
cold,&rsquo; and who has never died. &lsquo;According to the earlier
traditions of the <i>Avesta</i>,&rsquo; says Spiegel, &lsquo;Jima does
not die, but when evil and misery began to prevail on earth, retires to
a smaller space, a kind of garden or Eden, where he continues his happy
life with those who remained true to him.&rsquo; Such have been the
antecedents of our many beautiful myths which ascribe even an earthly
immortality to the great,&mdash;to Barbarossa, Arthur, and even to the
heroes of humbler races as Hiawatha and Glooscap of North American
tribes,&mdash;who are or were long believed to have &lsquo;sailed into
the fiery sunset,&rsquo; or sought some fair island, or to slumber in a
hidden grotto, until the world shall have grown up to their stature and
requires their return.</p>
<p>In Japan the (Sintoo) god of Hell is now named Amma, and one may
suspect that it is some imitation of Yama by reason of the majesty he
still retains in the popular conception. He is pictured as a grave man,
wearing a judicial cap, and no cruelties seem to be attributed to him
personally, but only to the <i>oni</i> or demons of whom he is
lord.</p>
<p>The kindly characteristics of the Hindu Yama seem in Persia to have
been replaced by the bitterness of Ahriman, or Anra-mainyu, the genius
of evil. Haug interprets Anra-mainyu as &lsquo;Death-darting.&rsquo;
The word is the counterpart of Spe&ntilde;ta-mainyu, and means
originally the &lsquo;throttling spirit;&rsquo; being thus from
<i>anh</i>, philologically the root of all evil, as we shall see when
we consider its dragon brood. Professor Whitney translates the name
&lsquo;Malevolent.&rsquo; But, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284"
href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>whatever may be the meaning
of the word, there is little doubt that the Twins of Vedic
Mythology&mdash;Yama and Yami&mdash;parted into genii of Day and Night,
and were ultimately spiritualised in the Spirit of Light and Spirit of
Darkness which have made the basis of all popular theology from the
time of Zoroaster until this day.</p>
<p>Nothing can be more remarkable than the extreme difference between
the ancient Hindu and the Persian view of death. As to the former it
was the happy introduction to Yama, to the latter it was the visible
seal of Ahriman&rsquo;s equality with Ormuzd. They held it in absolute
horror. The Towers of Silence stand in India to-day as monuments of
this darkest phase of the Pars&icirc; belief. The dead body belonged to
Ahriman, and was left to be devoured by wild creatures; and although
the raising of towers for the exposure of the corpse, so limiting its
consumption to birds, has probably resulted from a gradual rationalism
which has from time to time suggested that by such means souls of the
good may wing their way to Ormuzd, yet the Pars&icirc; horror of death
is strong enough to give rise to such terrible suspicions, even if they
were unfounded, as those which surrounded the Tower (Khao&rsquo;s
Dokhma) in June 1877. The strange behaviour of the corpse-bearers in
leaving one tower, going to another, and afterwards (as was said)
secretly repairing to the first, excited the belief that a man had been
found alive in the first and was afterwards murdered. The story seems
to have begun with certain young Pars&icirc;s themselves, and, whether
it be true or not, they have undoubtedly interpreted rightly the
ancient feeling of that sect with regard to all that had been within
the kingdom of the King of Terrors. &lsquo;As sickness and
death,&rsquo; says Professor Whitney, &lsquo;were supposed to be the
work of the malignant powers, the dead body itself was regarded with
superstitious horror. It had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href=
"#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>been gotten by the demons into
their own peculiar possession, and became a chief medium through which
they exercised their defiling action upon the living. Everything that
came into its neighbourhood was unclean, and to a certain extent
exposed to the influences of the malevolent spirits, until purified by
the ceremonies which the law prescribed.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5233src" href="#xd26e5233" name="xd26e5233src">7</a> It is to be
feared this notion has crept in among the Brahmans; the <i>Indian
Mirror</i> (May 26, 1878) states that a Chandernagore lady, thrown into
the Ganges, but afterwards found to be alive, was believed to be
possessed by Dano (an evil spirit), and but for interference would have
found a watery grave. The Jews also were influenced by this belief, and
to this day it is forbidden a Cohen, or descendant of the priesthood,
to touch a dead body.</p>
<p>The audience at the Crystal Palace which recently witnessed the
performance of Euripides&rsquo; <i>Alcestis</i> could hardly, it is to
be feared, have realised the relation of the drama to their own
religion. Apollo induces the Fates to consent that Admetus shall not
die provided he can find a substitute for him. The pure Alcestis steps
forward and devotes herself to death to save her husband. Apollo tries
to persuade Death to give back Alcestis, but Death declares her fate
demanded by justice. While Alcestis is dying, Admetus bids her entreat
the gods for pity; but Alcestis says it is a god who has brought on the
necessity, and adds, &lsquo;Be it so!&rsquo; She sees the hall of the
dead, with &lsquo;the winged Pluto staring from beneath his black
eyebrows.&rsquo; She reminds her husband of the palace and regal sway
she might have enjoyed in Thessaly had she not left it for him.
Bitterly does Pheres reproach Admetus for accepting life through the
vicarious suffering and death of another. Then comes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>Hercules; he vanquishes Death; he leads forth
Alcestis from &lsquo;beneath into the light.&rsquo; With her he comes
into the presence of Admetus, who is still in grief. Admetus cannot
recognise her; but when he recognises her with joy, Hercules warns him
that it is not lawful for Alcestis to address him &lsquo;until she is
unbound from her consecration to the gods beneath, and <i>the third day
come</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It only requires a change of names to make Alcestis a Passion-play.
The unappeasable Justice which is as a Fate binding the deity, though
it may be satisfied vicariously; &lsquo;the last enemy, Death;&rsquo;
the atonement by sacrifice of a saintly human being, who from a
father&rsquo;s palace is brought by love freely to submit to death; the
son of a god (Zeus) by a human mother (Alcmene),&mdash;the god-man
Herakles,&mdash;commissioned to destroy earthly evils by twelve great
labours,&mdash;descending to conquer Death and deliver one of the
&lsquo;spirits in prison,&rsquo; the risen spirit not recognised at
first, as Jesus was not by Mary; still bearing the consecration of the
grave until the third day, which forbade intercourse with the living
(&lsquo;Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my
Father&rsquo;),&mdash;all these enable us to recognise in the theologic
edifices around us the fragments of a crumbled superstition as they lay
around Euripides.</p>
<p>From the old pictures of Christ&rsquo;s triumphal pilgrimage on
earth parallels for the chief Labours of Herakles may be found; he is
shown treading on the lion, asp, dragon, and Satan; but the myths
converge in the Descent into Hades and the conquest of Death. It is
remarkable that in the old pictures of Christ delivering souls from
Hades he is generally represented closely followed by Eve, whose form
so emerging would once have been to the greater part of Europe already
familiar as that of either Alcestis, Eurydice, or Persephone. One of
the earliest examples <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href=
"#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>of the familiar subject, Christ
conquering Death, is that in the ancient (tenth century) Missal of
Worms,&mdash;that city whose very name preserves the record of the same
combat under the guise of Siegfried and the Worm, or Dragon. The cross
is now the sword thrust near the monster&rsquo;s mouth. The picture
illustrates the chant of Holy Week: &lsquo;<span lang="la">De manu
Mortis liberabo eos, de Morte redimam eos. Ero Mors tua, O Mors; morsus
tuus ero, inferne.</span>&rsquo; From the pierced mouth of Death are
vomited flames, which remind us of his ethnical origin; but it is not
likely that to the christianised pagans of Worms the picture could ever
have conveyed an impression so weirdly horrible as that of their own
goddess of Death, Hel. &lsquo;Her hall is called Elvidnir, realm of the
cold storm: Hunger is her table; Starvation, her knife; Delay, her man;
Slowness, her maid; Precipice, her threshold; Care, her bed; burning
Anguish, the hangings of her apartments. One half of her body is livid,
the other half the colour of human flesh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the Scandinavian picture of the Abode of Death may be compared
the description of the Abode of Nin-ki-gal, the Assyrian Queen of
Death, from a tablet in the British Museum, translated by Mr. Fox

<p class="first">The Semitic tribes, undisturbed, like the importers of
their theology into the age of science, by the strata in which so many
perished animal kingdoms are entombed, attributed all death, even that
of animals, to the forbidden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>fruit. The Rabbins say that not
only Adam and Eve, but the animals in Eden, partook of that fruit, and
came under the power of Samma&euml;l the Violent, and of his agent
Azra&euml;l, the demon of Death. The Ph&oelig;nix, having refused this
food, preserved the power of renovating itself.</p>
<p>It is an example of the completeness and consistency with which a
theory may organise its myth, that the fatal demons are generally
represented as abhorring salt&mdash;the preserving agent and foe of
decay. The &lsquo;Covenant of Salt&rsquo; among the ancient Jews
probably had this significance, and the care with which Job salted his
sacrifice is considered elsewhere. Aubrey says, &lsquo;Toads (Saturnine
animals) are killed by putting salt upon them. I have seen the
experiment.&rsquo; The devil, as heir of death-demons, appears in all
European folklore as a hater of salt. A legend, told by Heine, relates
that a knight, wandering in a wood in Italy, came upon a ruin, and in
it a wondrous statue of the goddess of Beauty. Completely fascinated,
the knight haunted the spot day after day, until one evening he was met
by a servant who invited him to enter a villa which he had not before
remarked. What was his surprise to be ushered into the presence of the
living image of his adored statue! Amid splendour and flowers the
enraptured knight is presently seated with his charmer at a banquet.
Every luxury of the world is there; but there is no salt! When he hints
this want a cloud passes over the face of his Beauty. Presently he asks
the servant to bring the salt; the servant does so, shuddering; the
knight helps himself to it. The next sip of wine he takes elicits a cry
from him: it is liquid fire. Madness seizes upon him; caresses, burning
kisses follow, until he falls asleep on the bosom of his goddess. But
what visions! Now he sees her as a wrinkled crone, next a great bat
bearing a torch as it flutters around him, and again as a frightful
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>monster, whose head he cuts off in an agony of
terror. When the knight awakes it is in his own villa. He hastens to
his ruin, and to the beloved statue; he finds her fallen from the
pedestal, and the beautiful head cut from the neck lying at her
feet.</p>
<p>The Semitic Angel of Death is a figure very different from any that
we have considered. He is known in theology only in the degradation
which he suffered at the hands of the Rabbins, but originally was an
awful but by no means evil genius. The Persians probably imported him,
under the name of Asuman, for we do not find him mentioned in their
earlier books, and the name has a resemblance to the Hebrew
<i>shamad</i>, to exterminate, which would connect it with the biblical
&lsquo;destroyer&rsquo; Abaddon. This is rendered more probable because
the Zoroastrians believed in an earlier demon, V&iacute;zaresha, who
carried souls after death to the region of Deva-worshippers (India).
The Chaldaic Angel of Death, Malk-ad Mousa, may have derived his name
from the legend of his having approached Moses with the object of
forcing his soul out of his body, but, being struck by the glory of
Moses&rsquo; face, and by virtue of the divine name on his rod, was
compelled to retire. The legend is not so ancient as the name, and was
possibly a Saga suggested by the name; it is obviously the origin of
the tradition of the struggle between Michael and Satan for the body of
Moses (Jude 9.). This personification had thus declined among the Jews
into being evil enough to be identified with Sama&euml;l,&mdash;who, in
the Book of the Assumption of Moses, is named as his
assailant,&mdash;and subsequently with Satan himself, named in
connection with the New Testament version. It was on account of this
degradation of a being described in the earlier books of the Bible as
the commissioner of Jehovah that there was gradually developed among
the Jews two Angels of Death, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290"
href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>one (Sama&euml;l, or his
agent Azra&euml;l) for those who died out of the land of Israel, and
the other (Gabriel) for those who had the happier lot of dying in their
own country.</p>
<p>This relegation of Sama&euml;l to the wandering Jews&mdash;who if
they died abroad were not supposed to reach Paradise with facility, if
at all&mdash;is significant. For Sama&euml;l is pretty certainly a
conception borrowed from outlying Semitic tribes. What that conception
was we find in Job xviii. 18, where he is &lsquo;the king of
Terrors,&rsquo; and still more in the Arabic Azra&euml;l. The legend of
this typical Angel of Death is that he was promoted to his high office
for special service. When Allah was about to create man he sent the
angels Gabriel, Michael, and Israfil to the earth to bring clay of
different colours for that purpose; but the Earth warned them that the
being about to be formed would rebel against his creator and draw down
a curse upon her (the Earth), and they returned without bringing the
clay. Then Azra&euml;l was sent by Allah, and he executed his
commission without fear; and for this he was appointed the angel to
separate souls from bodies. Azra&euml;l had subordinate angels under
him, and these are alluded to in the opening lines of the Sura 79 of
the Koran:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">By the angels who tear forth the souls of some with
violence;</p>
<p class="line">And by those who draw forth the souls of others with
gentleness.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The souls of the righteous are drawn forth with
gentleness, those of the wicked torn from them in the way shown in the
Russian picture (<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>), which is indeed an
illustration of the same mythology.</p>
<p>These terrible tasks were indeed such as were only too likely to
bring Azra&euml;l into the evil repute of an executioner in the course
of time; but no degradation of him seems to have been developed among
the Moslems. He seems to have been associated in their minds with Fate,
and similar stories were told of him. Thus it is related that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>once when Azra&euml;l was passing by Solomon he
gazed intently upon a man with whom Solomon was conversing. Solomon
told his companion that it was the Angel of Death who was looking at
him, and the man replied, &lsquo;He seems to want me: order the wind to
carry me from hence into India;&rsquo; when this was done Azra&euml;l
approached Solomon and said, &lsquo;I looked earnestly at that man from
wonder, for I was commanded to take his soul in India.&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5310src" href="#xd26e5310" name=
"xd26e5310src">9</a></p>
<p>Azra&euml;l was often represented as presenting to the lips a cup of
poison. It is probable that this image arose from the ancient ordeal by
poison, whereby draughts, however manipulated beforehand with reference
to the results, were popularly held to be divinely mingled for
retributive or beneficent effects. &lsquo;Cup&rsquo; thus became among
Semitic tribes a symbol of Fate. The &lsquo;cup of consolation,&rsquo;
&lsquo;cup of wrath,&rsquo; &lsquo;cup of trembling,&rsquo; which we
read of in the Old Testament; the &lsquo;cup of blessing,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;cup of devils,&rsquo; spoken of by Paul, have this significance.
The cup of Nestor, ornamented with the dove (Iliad, xi. 632), was
probably a &lsquo;cup of blessing,&rsquo; and Mr. Schliemann has found
several of the same kind at Mycen&aelig;. The symbol was repeatedly
used by Christ,&mdash;&lsquo;Let this cup pass from me,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The cup that my Father hath given me to drink shall I not drink
it,&rsquo; &lsquo;Are ye able to drink of the cup that I drink
of,&rsquo;&mdash;and the familiar association of Azra&euml;l&rsquo;s
cup is expressed in the phrase &lsquo;taste of death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the most pleasing modifications of the belief in the Angel of
Death is that found by Lepsius<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5317src"
href="#xd26e5317" name="xd26e5317src">10</a> among the Mohammedan
negroes of Kordofan. Osra&icirc;n (Azra&euml;l), it is said, receives
the souls of the dead, and leads the good to their reward, the bad to
punishment. &lsquo;He lives in a tree, el segerat mohana (the tree of
fulfilling), which has as many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292"
href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>leaves as there are
inhabitants in the world. On each leaf is a name, and when a child is
born a new one grows. If any one becomes ill his leaf fades, and should
he be destined to die, Osra&icirc;n breaks it off. Formerly he used to
come visibly to those whom he was going to carry away, and thus put
them in great terror. Since the prophet&rsquo;s time, however, he has
become invisible; for when he came to fetch Mohammed&rsquo;s soul he
told him that it was not good that by his visible appearance he should
frighten mankind. They might then easily die of terror, before praying;
for he himself, although a courageous and spirited man, was somewhat
perturbed at his appearance. Therefore the prophet begged God to make
Osra&icirc;n invisible, which prayer was granted.&rsquo; Mr. Mackenzie
adds on this that, among the Moravian Jews, at new moon a branch is
held in its light, and the name of a person pronounced: his face will
appear between the horns of the moon, and should he be destined to die
the leaves will fade.</p>

</div>
<p>Mr. John Ruskin has been very severe upon the Italians for the
humour with which they introduce Death as a person of their masque.
&lsquo;When I was in Venice in 1850,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;the most
popular piece of the <i>comic</i> opera was &ldquo;Death and the
Cobbler,&rdquo; in which the point of the plot was the success of a
village cobbler as a physician, in consequence of the appearance of
Death to him beside the bed of every patient who was not to recover;
and the most applauded scene in it was one in which the physician,
insolent in success, and swollen with luxury, was himself taken down
into the abode of Death, and thrown into an agony of terror by being
shown lives of men, under the form of wasting lamps, and his own ready
to expire.&rsquo; On which he expresses the opinion that &lsquo;this
endurance of fearful images is partly associated with indecency, partly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>with general fatuity and weakness of
mind.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5336src" href="#xd26e5336"
name="xd26e5336src">11</a> But may it not rather be the healthy
reaction from morbid images of terror, with which a purely natural and
inevitable event has so long been invested by priests, and portrayed in
such popular pictures as &lsquo;The Dance of Death?&rsquo; The mocking
laughter with which the skeletons beset the knight in our picture
(<a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>), from the wall of La Chaise Dieu,
Auvergne, marks the priestly terrorism, which could not fail to be
vulgarised even more by the frivolous. In 1424 there was a masquerade
of the Dance of Death in the Cemetery of the Innocents at Paris,
attended by the Duke of Bedford and the Duke of Burgundy, just returned
from battle. It may have been the last outcome in the west of
Kali&rsquo;s dance over the slain; but it is fortunate when Fanaticism
has no worse outcome than Folly. The Skeleton Death <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>has
the advantage over earlier forms of suggesting the naturalness of
death. It is more scientific. The gradual discovery by the people that
death is not caused by sin has largely dissipated its horrors in
regions where the ignorance and impostures of priestcraft are of daily
observation; and although the reaction may not be expressed with good
taste, there would seem to be in it a certain vigour of nature,
reasserting itself in simplicity.</p>
<p>In the northern world we are all too sombre in the matter. It is the
ages of superstition which have moulded our brains, and too generally
given to our natural love of life the unnatural counterpart of a terror
of death. What has been artificially bred into us can be cultivated out
of us. There are indeed deaths corresponding to the two
Angels&mdash;the death that comes by lingering disease and pain, and
that which comes by old age. There are indeed Azra&euml;ls in our
cities who poison the food and drink of the people, and mingle death in
the cup of water; and of them there should be increasing horror until
the gentler angel abides with us, and death by old age becomes normal.
The departure from life being a natural condition of entering upon it,
it is melancholy indeed that it should be ideally confused with the
pains and sorrows often attending it. It is fabled that Menippus the
Cynic, travelling through Hades, knew which were the kings there by
their howling louder than the rest. They howled loudest because they
had parted from most pleasures on earth. But all the happy and young
have more reason to lament untimely death than kings. The only tragedy
of Death is the ruin of living Love. Mr. Watts, in his great picture of
Love and Death (Grosvenor Gallery, 1877), revealed the real horror. Not
that skeleton which has its right time and place, not the winged demon
(called angel), who has no right time or place, is here, but a huge,
hard, heartless <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295"
name="pb295">295</a>]</span>form, as of man half-blocked out of marble;
a terrible emblem of the remorseless force that embodies the
incompleteness and ignorance of mankind&mdash;a force that steadily
crushes hearts where intellects are devoting their energies to alien
worlds. Poor Love has little enough science; his puny arm stretched out
to resist the colossal form is weak as the prayers of agonised parents
and lovers directed against never-swerving laws; he is almost
exhausted; his lustrous wings are broken and torn in the struggle; the
dove at his feet crouches mateless; the rose that climbed on his door
is prostrate; over his shoulder the beam-like arm has set the stony
hand against the door where the rose of joy must fall.</p>
<p>The aged when they die do but follow the treasures that have gone
before. One by one the old friends have left them, the sweet ties
parted, and the powers to enjoy and help become feeble. When of the
garden that once bloomed around them memory alone is left, friendly is
death to scatter also the leaves of that last rose where the loved ones
are sleeping. This is the real office of death. Nay, even when it comes
to the young and happy it is not Death but Disease that is the real
enemy; in disease there is almost no compensation at all but learning
its art of war; but Death is Nature&rsquo;s pity for helpless pain;
where love and knowledge can do no more it comes as a release from
sufferings which were sheer torture if prolonged. The presence of death
is recognised oftenest by the cessation of pain. Superstition has done
few heavier wrongs to humanity than by the mysterious terrors with
which it has invested that change which, to the simpler ages, was
pictured as the gentle river Lethe, flowing from the abode of sleep,
from which the shades drank oblivion alike of their woes and of the
joys from which they were torn. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having indicated, necessarily in mere outline and by
selected examples, the chief obstacles encountered by primitive man,
and his apprehensions, which he personified as demons, it becomes my
next task to show how and why many of these demons declined from their
terrible proportions and made way for more general forms, expressing
comparatively abstract conceptions of physical evil. This will involve
some review of the processes through which man&rsquo;s necessary
adaptation to his earthly environment brought him to the era of Combat
with multiform obstruction.</p>
<p>There was, until within a few recent years, in a mountain of
Travancore, India, an ancient, gigantic Tree, regarded by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name="pb300">300</a>]</span>the
natives as the residence of a powerful and dangerous deity who reigned
over the mountains and the wild beasts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5376src" href="#xd26e5376" name="xd26e5376src">1</a> Sacrifices
were offered to this tree, sermons preached before it, and it seems to
have been the ancient cathedral of the district. Its trunk was so large
that four men with outstretched arms could not compass it.</p>
<p>This tree in its early growth may symbolise the upspringing of
natural religion. Its first green leaves may be regarded as
corresponding to the first crude imaginations of man as written, for
instance, on leaves of the Vedas. Perceiving in nature, as we have
seen, a power of contrivance like his own, a might far superior to his
own, man naturally considered that all things had been created and were
controlled by invisible giants; and bowing helplessly beneath them sang
thus his hymns and supplications.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This earth belongs to Varuna, the king, and the wide sky,
with its ends far apart: the two seas (sky and ocean) are
Varuna&rsquo;s loins; he is also contained in this drop of water. He
who would flee far beyond the sky even he would not be rid of Varuna.
His spies proceed from heaven towards this earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Through want of strength, thou ever strong and bright god,
have I gone wrong: have mercy, have mercy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;However we break thy laws from day to day, men as we are, O
god Varuna, do not deliver us to death!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it an old sin, Varuna, that thou wished to destroy the
friend who always praises thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Indra, have mercy, give me my daily bread! Raise up wealth
to the worshipper, thou mighty Dawn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou art the giver of horses, Indra, thou art the giver of
cows, the giver of corn, the strong lord of wealth: the old guide of
man disappointing no desires: to him we <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>address this song.
All this wealth around here is known to be thine alone: take from it
conqueror, bring it hither!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In these characteristic sentences from various hymns we behold man
making his first contract with the ruling powers of nature: so much
adoration and flattery on his part for so much benefit on theirs. But
even in these earliest hymns there are intimations that the gods were
not fulfilling their side of the engagement. &lsquo;Why is it,&rsquo;
pleads the worshipper, &lsquo;that you wish to destroy one who always
praises you? Was it an old sin?&rsquo; The simple words unconsciously
report how faithfully man was performing his part of the contract.
Having omitted no accent of the prayer, praise, or ritual, he supposes
the continued indifference of the gods must be due to an old sin, one
he has forgotten, or perhaps one committed by some ancestor.</p>
<p>In this state of mind the suggestion would easily take root that
words alone were too cheap to be satisfactory to the gods. There must
be offerings. Like earthly kings they must have their revenues. We thus
advance to the phase of sacrifices. But still neither in answer to
prayer, flattery, or sacrifice did the masses receive health or wealth.
Poverty, famine, death, still continued their remorseless course with
the silent machinery of sun, moon, and star.</p>
<p>But why, then, should man have gone on fulfilling his part of the
contract&mdash;believing and worshipping deities, who when he begged
for corn gave him famine, and when he asked for fish gave him a
serpent? The priest intervened with ready explanation. And here we may
consult the holy Tree of Travancore again? Why should that particular
Tree&mdash;of a species common in the district and not usually very
large&mdash;have grown so huge? &lsquo;Because it is holy,&rsquo; said
the priest. &lsquo;Because it was believed holy,&rsquo; says the fact.
For ages the blood and ashes of victims fed its roots and swelled its
trunk; until, by an argument not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302"
href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>confined to India, the
dimensions of the superstition were assumed to prove its truth. When
the people complained that all their offerings and worship did not
bring any returns the priest replied, You stint the gods and they stint
you. The people offered the fattest of their flocks and fruits: More
yet! said the priest. They built fine altars and temples for the gods:
More yet! said the priest. They built fine houses for the priests, and
taxed themselves to support them. And when thus, fed by popular
sacrifices and toils, the religion had grown to vast power, the priest
was able to call to his side the theologian for further explanation.
The theologian and the priest said&mdash;&lsquo;Of course there must be
good reasons why the gods do not answer all your prayers (if they did
not answer some you would be utterly consumed); mere mortals must not
dare to inquire into their mysteries; but that there are gods, and that
they do attend to human affairs, is made perfectly plain by this
magnificent array of temples, and by the care with which they have
supplied all the wants of us, their particular friends, whose cheeks,
as you see, hang down with fatness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If, after this explanation, any scepticism or rebellion arose among
the less favoured, the priest might easily
add&mdash;&lsquo;Furthermore, we and our temples are now institutions;
we are so strong and influential that it is evident that the gods have
appointed us to be their representatives on earth, the dispensers of
their favours. Also, of their disfavours. We are able to make up for
the seeming indifference of the gods, rewarding you if you give us
honour and wealth, but ruining you if you turn heretical.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So grew the holy Tree. But strong as it was there was something
stronger. Some few years ago a missionary from London went to
Travancore, and desired to build a chapel near the same tree, no doubt
to be in the way of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303"
name="pb303">303</a>]</span>its worshippers and to borrow some of the
immemorial sanctity of the spot. This missionary fixed a hungry eye
upon that holy timber, and reflected how much holier it would be if
ending its career in the beams of a christian chapel. So one
day&mdash;English authorities being conveniently near&mdash;he and his
workmen began to cut down the sacred Tree. The natives gradually
gathered around, and looked on with horror. While the cutting proceeded
a tiger drew near, but shouts drove him off: the natives breathed
freer; the demon had come and looked on, but could not protect the Tree
from the Englishman. They still shuddered, however, at the sacrilege,
and when at last the Holy Tree of Travancore fell, its crash was
mingled with the cries and screams of its former worshippers. The
victorious missionary may be pointing out in his chapel the cut-up
planks which reveal the impotence of the deity so long feared by the
natives; and perhaps he is telling them of the bigness of <i>his</i>
Tree, and claiming its flourishing condition in Europe as proof of its
supernatural character. Possibly he may omit to mention the blood and
ashes which have fattened the root and enlarged the trunk of <i>his</i>
Holy Tree!</p>
<p>That Tree in Travancore could never have been so destroyed if the
primitive natural religion in which lay its deeper root had not
previously withered. The gods, the natural forces, which through so
many ages had not heeded man&rsquo;s daily martyrdoms, had now for a
long time been shown quite as impotent to protect their own shrines,
images, holy trees, and other interests. The priests as vainly invoked
those gods to save their own country from subjugation by other nations
with foreign gods, as the masses had invoked their personal aid. For a
long time the gods in some parts of India have received only a formal
service, coextensive with their association with a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>lingering order, or as part of princely
establishments; but they topple down from time to time, as the masses
realise their freedom to abandon them with impunity. They are at the
mercy of any strong heretic who arises. The following narrative, quoted
by Mr. Herbert Spencer, presents a striking example of what some
Hindoos had been doing before the missionary cut down the Tree at
Travancore:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A Nepaul king, Rum Bah&acirc;dur, whose beautiful queen,
finding her lovely face had been disfigured by smallpox, poisoned
herself, cursed his kingdom, her doctors, and the gods of Nepaul,
vowing vengeance on all. Having ordered the doctors to be flogged, and
the right ear and nose of each to be cut off, he then wreaked his
vengeance on the gods of Nepaul, and after abusing them in the most
gross way, he accused them of having obtained from him 12,000 goats,
some hundred-weights of sweetmeats, 2000 gallons of milk, &amp;c.,
under false pretences. He then ordered all the artillery, varying from
three to twelve-pounders, to be brought in front of the palace. All the
guns were then loaded to the muzzle, and down he marched to the
headquarters of the Nepaul deities. All the guns were drawn up in front
of the several deities, honouring the most sacred with the heaviest
metal. When the order to fire was given, many of the chiefs and
soldiers ran away panic-stricken, and others hesitated to obey the
sacrilegious order; and not till several gunners had been cut down were
the guns opened. Down came the gods and the goddesses from their
hitherto sacred positions; and after six hours&rsquo; heavy
cannonading, not a vestige of the deities remained.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However panic-stricken the Nepaulese may have been at this ferocious
manifestation, it was but a storm bred out of a more general mental and
moral condition. Rum <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305"
name="pb305">305</a>]</span>Bah&acirc;dur only laid low in a few
moments images of gods who, passing from the popular interest, had been
successively laid to sleep on the innumerable shelves of Hindu
mythology. The early Dualism was developed into Moral Man on one side,
and Unmoral Nature on the other. Man had discovered that moral order in
nature was represented solely by his own power: by his culture or
neglect the plant or animal grew or withered, and where his control did
not extend, there sprang the noxious weed or beast. So far as good gods
had been imagined they were respected now only as incarnate in men. But
the active powers of evil still remained, hurtful and hateful to man,
and the pessimist view of nature became inevitable. To man engaged in
his life-and-death struggle with nature many a beauty which now
nourishes the theist&rsquo;s optimism was lost. The fragrant flower was
a weed to the man hungry for bread, and he viewed many an idle treasure
with the disappointment of S&acirc;di when, travelling in the desert,
he found a bag in which he hoped to discover grain, but found only
pearls. Fatal to every deity not anthropomorphic was the long
pessimistic phase of human faith. Each became more purely a demon, and
passed on the road to become a devil.</p>
<p>Many particular demons man conquered as he progressively carried
order amid the ruggedness and wildness of his planet. Every new weapon
or implement he invented punctured a thousand phantoms. Only in the
realms he could not yet conquer remained the hostile forces to which he
ascribed pr&aelig;ternatural potency, because not able to pierce them
and see through them. Nevertheless, the early demonic forms had to give
way, for man had discovered that they were not his masters. He could
cut down the Upas and root up the nightshade; he had bruised many a
serpent&rsquo;s head and slain many a wolf. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>In
detail innumerable enemies had been proved his inferiors in strength
and intelligence. Important migrations took place: man passes,
geographically, away from the region of some of his worst enemies,
inhabits countries more fruitful, less malarious, his habitat exceeding
that of his animal foe in range; and, still better, he passes by mental
migration out of the stone age, out of other helpless ages, to the age
of metal and the skill to fashion and use it. He has made the
fire-fiend his friend. No longer henceforth a naked savage, with bit of
stone or bone only to meet the crushing powers of the world and win its
reluctant supplies!</p>
<p>There is a sense far profounder than its charming play of fancy in
Heine&rsquo;s account of the &lsquo;Gods in Exile,&rsquo; an essay
which Mr. Pater well describes as &lsquo;full of that strange blending
of sentiment which is characteristic of the traditions of the Middle
Age concerning the Pagan religions.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5432src" href="#xd26e5432" name="xd26e5432src">2</a> Heine
writes: &lsquo;Let me briefly remind the reader how the gods of the
older world, at the time of the definite triumph of Christianity, that
is, in the third century, fell into painful embarrassments, which
greatly resembled certain tragical situations of their earlier life.
They now found themselves exposed to the same troublesome necessities
to which they had once before been exposed during the primitive ages,
in that revolutionary epoch when the Titans broke out of the custody of
Orcus, and, piling Pelion on Ossa, scaled Olympus. Unfortunate gods!
They had, then, to take flight ignominiously, and hide themselves among
us here on earth under all sorts of disguises. Most of them betook
themselves to Egypt, where for greater security they assumed the form
of animals, as is generally known. Just in the same way they had to
take flight again, and seek entertainment in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name=
"pb307">307</a>]</span>remote hiding-places, when those iconoclastic
zealots, the black brood of monks, broke down all the temples, and
pursued the gods with fire and curses. Many of these unfortunate
emigrants, entirely deprived of shelter and ambrosia, had now to take
to vulgar handicrafts as a means of earning their bread. In these
circumstances, many, whose sacred groves had been confiscated, let
themselves out for hire as wood-cutters in Germany, and had to drink
beer instead of nectar. Apollo seems to have been content to take
service under graziers, and as he had once kept the cows of Admetus, so
he lived now as a shepherd in Lower Austria. Here, however, having
become suspected, on account of his beautiful singing, he was
recognised by a learned monk as one of the old pagan gods, and handed
over to the spiritual tribunal. On the rack he confessed that he was
the god Apollo; and before his execution he begged that he might be
suffered to play once more upon the lyre and to sing a song. And he
played so touchingly, and sang with such magic, and was withal so
beautiful in form and feature that all the women wept, and many of them
were so deeply impressed that they shortly afterwards fell sick. And
some time afterwards the people wished to drag him from the grave
again, that a stake might be driven through his body, in the belief
that he had been a vampire, and that the sick women would by this means
recover. But they found the grave empty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Naturally: it is hard to bury Apollo. The next time he appeared was,
no doubt, as musical director in the nearest cathedral. The young
singers and artists discovered by such severe lessons that it was
dangerous to sing Pagan ballads too realistically; that a cowl is
capable of a high degree of decoration; that Pan&rsquo;s pipe sounds
well evolved into an organ; that Cupids look just as well if called
Cherubs. It is odd that it should have required Robert <span class=

<p class="first">So in one direction grew the hermitage to the Vatican;
so Zeus regained his throne by exchanging his thunderbolts for
Peter&rsquo;s keys, and Mars regained his steed as St. George, and
Hercules as Christ wrestles with Death once more. But while these
artificial restorations were going on in one direction, in another some
of the gods were passing through many countries, outwitting and
demolishing their former selves as lowered to demons. There are many
legends which report this strange phase of development, one of the
finest being that of The Goban Saor, told by Mr. Kennedy. The King of
Munster sent for this wonderful craftsman to build him a castle. The
Goban could fashion a spear with three strokes of his hammer&mdash;St.
Patrick, who found the Trinity in the shamrock, may have determined the
number of strokes,&mdash;and when he wished to drive in nails high up,
had only to throw his hammer at them. On his way to work for the King,
Goban, accompanied by his son, passed the night at the house of a
farmer, whose daughters&mdash;one dark and industrious, the other fair
and idle&mdash;received from him (Goban) three bits of advice:
&lsquo;Always have the head of an old woman by the hob; warm yourselves
with your work in the morning; and some time before I come back take
the skin of a newly-killed sheep to the market, and bring itself and
the price of it home again.&rsquo; As Goban, with his son, journeyed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href="#pb309" name=
"pb309">309</a>]</span>on, they found a poor man vainly trying to roof
his house with three joists and mud; and by simply making one end of
each joist rest on the middle of another, the other ends being on the
wall, the structure was perfect. He relieved puzzled carpenters by
putting up for them the pegless and nailless bridge described in
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Commentaries. Having done various great things,
Goban returns to the homestead of the girls who had received his three
bits of advice. The idle one had, of course, blundered at each point,
and been ridiculed in the market for her proposition to bring back the
sheep&rsquo;s skin and its price. The other, by kindly taking in an
aged female relative, by working till she was warm, and by plucking and
selling the wool of the sheep&rsquo;s skin and bringing home the
latter, had obeyed the Goban&rsquo;s advice, and was selected as his
daughter-in-law&mdash;the prince attending the wedding. Now, as to
building the castle, Goban knew that the King had employed on previous
castles four architects and then slain them, so that they should never
build another palace equal to his. He therefore says he has left at
home a necessary implement which his wife will only give to himself or
one of royal blood. The King sends his son, who is kept as hostage till
the husband&rsquo;s safe return.</p>
<p>This is the Master Smith of Norse fable, who has a chair from which
none can rise, and who therein binds the devil; which again is the
story of Hephaistos, and the chair in which he entrapped Hera until she
revealed the secret of his birth. The &lsquo;devil&rsquo; whom the
Master Smith entraps is, in Norse mythology, simply Loki: and as Loki
is a degraded Hephaistos, fire in its demonic forms, we have in all
these legends the fire-fiend fought with fire.</p>
<p>This re-dualisation of the gods into demonic and saintly forms had a
long preparation. The forces that brought it about may be seen already
beginning in Hesiod&rsquo;s representations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>of
the gods, in their presentation on the stage by Euripides, in a manner
certain to demonise them to the vulgar, and to subject them to such
laughter among scholars as still rings across the ages in the divine
dialogues of Lucian. What the gods had become to the Lucians before
they reached the Heines may be gathered from the accompanying
caricature (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5470src" href="#xd26e5470" name="xd26e5470src">3</a> Nothing can
be more curious than the encounters of the gods with their dead selves,
their Manes. What unconscious ingenuity in the combinations! St. Martin
on his grey steed divides with the beggar the cloud-cloak of Wodan on
his black horse, treading down just such paupers in his wild hunt; as
saint he now shelters those whom as storm-demon he chilled; but the
identity of Junker Martin is preserved in both titles and myths, and
the Martinhorns (cakes), twisted after fashion of the horns of goat or
buck pursued by Wodan, are deemed potent like horse-shoes to defend
house or stable from the outlawed god.<a class="noteref" id=

<p>The more impressive and attractive myths transferred to christian
saints&mdash;as the flowers sacred to Freyja became Our
Lady&rsquo;s-glove, or slipper, or smock&mdash;there remained to the
old gods, in their own name, only the repulsive and puerile, and by
this means they were doomed at once to become unmitigated knaves and
fools. If Titans, J&ouml;tunn or Jinni, they were giant humbugs, whom
any small Hans or Jack might outwit and behead. Our Fairy lore is full
of stories which show that in the North as well as in Latin countries
there had already been a long preparation for the contempt poured by
Christianity upon the Norse deities. Many of the stories, as they now
stand in Folktales, speak of the vanquished demon or giant as the
devil, but it is perfectly easy to detach the being meant from the name
so indiscriminately bestowed by christian priests upon most of the
outlawed deities. In Lithuania, where survived too much reverence for
some of the earlier deities to admit <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb312" href="#pb312" name="pb312">312</a>]</span>of their being
identified with the devil, we still find them triumphed over by the wit
and skill of the artisan. Such is the case in a favourite popular
legend of that country in which Perkunas&mdash;the ancient Thunder-god,
corresponding to Perun in Russia&mdash;is involved in disgrace along
with the devil by the sagacity and skill of a carpenter. The aged god,
the venerable Devil, and the young Carpenter, united for a journey.
Perkun kept the beasts off with thunder and lightning, the Devil hunted
up food, the Carpenter cooked. At length they built a hut and lived in
it, and planted the ground with vegetables. Presently a thief invaded
their garden. Perkun and the Devil successively tried to catch him, but
were well thrashed; whereas the Carpenter by playing the fiddle
fascinated the thief, who was a witch, a hag whose hand the fiddler
managed to get into a split tree (under pretence of giving her a music
lesson), holding her there till she gave up her iron waggon and the
whip which she had used on his comrades. After this the three, having
decided to separate, disputed as to which should have the hut; and they
finally agreed that it should be the possession of him who should
succeed in frightening the two others. The Devil raised a storm which
frightened Perkun, and Perkun with his thunder and lightning frightened
the Devil; but the Carpenter held out bravely, and, in the middle of
the night, came in with the witch&rsquo;s waggon, and, cracking her
whip, the Devil and Perkun both took flight, leaving the Carpenter in
possession of the hut.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5526src" href=
"#xd26e5526" name="xd26e5526src">5</a></p>
<p>So far as Perkun is concerned, and may be regarded as representative
of the gods, the hut may be symbol of Europe, and the Carpenter type of
the power which conquered all that was left of them after their fair or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>noble associations had been transferred to
christian forms. Somewhat later, the devil was involved in a like fate,
as we shall have to consider in a future chapter.</p>
<p>The most horrible superstitions, if tracked in their popular
development, reveal with special impressiveness the progressive
emancipation of man from the phantasms of ferocity which represented
his primal helplessness. The universal werewolf superstition, for
instance, drew its unspeakable horrors from deep and wide-spreading
roots. Originating, probably, in occasional relapses to cannibalism
among tribes or villages which found themselves amid circumstances as
urgent as those which sometimes lead a wrecked crew to draw lots which
shall die to support the rest, it would necessarily become demonised by
the necessity of surrounding cannibalism with dangers worse than
starvation. But it would seem that individuals are always liable, by
arrest of development which usually takes the form of disease or
insanity, to be dragged back to the savage condition of their race. In
the course of this dark history, we note first an increasing tendency
to show the means of the transformation difficult. In the <i>Volsunga
Saga</i> it is by simply putting on a &lsquo;wolf-shirt&rsquo;
(wolfskin) that a man may become a wolf. Then it is said it is done by
a belt made of the skin of a man who has been hung&mdash;all executed
persons being sacred to Wodan (because not dying a natural death), to
whom also the wolf was sacred. Then it is added, that the belt must be
marked with the signs of the zodiac, and have a buckle with seven
teeth. Then it is said that &lsquo;only a seventh son&rsquo; is
possessed of this diabolical power; or others say one whose brows meet
over his nose. The means of detecting werewolves and retransforming
them to human shape multiplied as those of transformation diminished in
number, and such remedies reflected the advance of human <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314</a>]</span>skill. The werewolf could be restored by
crossing his path with a knife or polished steel; by a sword laid on
the ground with point towards him; by a silver ball. Human skill was
too much for him. In Posen mothers had discovered that one who had
bread in his or her mouth could by even such means discover werewolves;
and fathers, to this hint about keeping &lsquo;the wolf from the
door,&rsquo; added that no one could be attacked by any such monster if
he were in a cornfield. The Slav levelled a plough at him. Thus by one
prescription and another, and each representing a part of man&rsquo;s
victory over chaos, the werewolf was driven out of all but a few
&lsquo;unlucky&rsquo; days in the year, and especially found his last
refuge in Twelfth Night. But even on that night the werewolf might be
generally escaped by the simple device of not speaking of him. If a
wolf had to be spoken of he was then called Vermin, and Dr. Wuttke
mentions a parish priest named Wolf in East Prussia who on Twelfth
Night was addressed as Mr. Vermin! The actual wolf being already out of
the forests in most places by art of the builder and the architect; the
phantasmal wolf driven out of fear for most of the year by man&rsquo;s
recognition of his own superiority to this exterminated beast; even the
proverbial &lsquo;ears&rsquo; of the vanishing werewolf ceased to be
visible when on his particular fest-night his name was not
mentioned.</p>
<p>The last execution of a man for being an occasional werewolf was, I
believe, in 1589, near Cologne, there being some evidence of
cannibalism. But nine years later, in France, where the belief in the
<i>Loup-garou</i> had been intense, a man so accused was simply shut up
in a mad-house. It is an indication of the revolution which has
occurred, that when next governments paid attention to werewolves it
was because certain vagabonds went about professing to be able to
transform themselves into wolves, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315"
href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>in order to extort money from
the more weak-minded and ignorant peasants.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5550src" href="#xd26e5550" name="xd26e5550src">6</a> There could
hardly be conceived a more significant history: the werewolf leaves
where he entered. Of ignorance and weakness trying, too often in vain,
&lsquo;to keep the wolf from the door,&rsquo; was born this voracious
phantom; with the beggar and vagabond, survivals of helplessness become
inveterate, he wanders thin and crafty. He keeps out of the way of all
culture, whether of field or mind. So is it indeed with all demons in
decline&mdash;of which I can here only adduce a few characteristic
examples. So runs the rune&mdash;</p>

Croft</i>, is derived from the ancient belief that unless some wild
place is left to the sylvan spirits they will injure the grain and
vegetables; and, no doubt, some such notion leads the farmers of
Thurgau still to graft mistletoe upon their fruit-trees. Many who can
smile at such customs do yet preserve in their own minds, or those of
their servants or neighbours, crofts which the ploughshare of science
is forbidden to touch, and where the pr&aelig;ternatural troops still
hide their shrivelled forms. But this wild girdle becomes ever
narrower, and the images within it tend to blend with rustling leaf and
straw, and the insects, and to be otherwise invisible, save to that
second sight which is received from Glam. As in some shadow-pantomime,
the deities and demons pursue each other in endless procession,
dropping down as awe-inspiring Titans, vanishing as grotesque
pigmies&mdash;vanishing beyond the lamp into Nothingness!</p>
<p>So came most of the monsters we have been describing&mdash;Animals,
Volcanoes, Icebergs, Deserts, though they might be&mdash;by growing
culture and mastery of nature to be called &lsquo;the little

"ChIR&#332;N"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Chi;&Iota;&Rho;&Omega;&Nu;</span></span>) is represented as
labouring under the effects of age and blindness, and supporting
himself by the aid of a crooked staff, as he repairs to the Delphian
quack-doctor for relief. The figure of the centaur is made to ascend by
the aid of a companion, both being furnished with the masks and other
attributes of the comic performers. Above are the mountains, and on
them the nymphs of Parnassus (<span class="trans" title=
"NYMPhAI"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Nu;&Upsilon;&Mu;&Phi;&Alpha;&Iota;</span></span>), who, like all
the other actors in the scene, are disguised with masks, and those of a
very gross character&#8202;&hellip;. Even a pun is employed to heighten
the drollery of the scene, for instead of <span class="trans" title=

Pythian, placed over the head of the burlesque Apollo, it seems evident

who is the leaf-crowned figure, without mask, on the right hand? Was it
some early Offenbach, who found such representation of the gods welcome
at Athens where the attempt to produce our modern Offenbach&rsquo;s

latter kind of hungry werewolf a specimen still occasionally revisits
the glimpses of the moonshine which, for too many minds, still replaces
daylight. So recently as January 17, 1878, one Kate Bedwell, a
&lsquo;pedlar,&rsquo; was sentenced in the Marylebone Police Court,
London, to three months&rsquo; hard labour for obtaining various sums
of money, amounting to 9s. 10d., by terrorism, from Eliza Rolf, a cook.
The pedlar came to the plaintiff&rsquo;s place of work and asked her if
she would like to have her fortune told. Eliza replied, &lsquo;No, I
know it; it is hard work or starving.&rsquo; The fortune-teller asked
her next time if she would have her planet ruled; the other still said
no; but her nerves yielded when the &lsquo;Drud&rsquo; told her
&lsquo;she lived under three stars, one good the others bad, and that
she could disfigure her or turn her into something else.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thank God, she did not!&rsquo; exclaimed the poor woman in
court. However, she seemed to have trusted rather in her money than in
any other providence for her immunity from an unhappy transformation.
But even into this rare depth of ignorance enough light had penetrated
to enable Eliza to cope with her werewolf in the civilised way of
haling her before a magistrate. When Fenris gets three months with hard
labour, he no doubt realises that he has exceeded his mental habitat,
and that the invisible cords have bound him at last.&nbsp;<a class=

<p class="first">After all those brave victories of man over the first
chaos, organic and inorganic, whose effect upon his phantasms has been
indicated; after fire had slain its thousands, and iron its tens of
thousands of his demons, and the rough artisan become a Nemesis with
his rudder and wheel pursuing the hosts of darkness back into Night and
Invisibility; still stood the grim fact of manyformed pain and evil in
the world, still defying the ascending purposes of mankind. Moreover,
confronting these, he is by no means so different mentally from that
man he was before conquering many foes in detail, and laying their
phantoms, as he was morally. More courage man had gained, and more
defiance; and, intellectually, a step had been taken, if only one: he
had learned that his evils are related to each other. Hunger is of many
heads and forms. Its yawning throat may be seen in the brilliant sky
that lasts till it is as brass, in the deluge, the earthquake, in claw
and fang; and then these together do but relate the hunger-brood to
Fire and Ferocity; the summer sunbeam <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb319" href="#pb319" name="pb319">319</a>]</span>may be venomous as a
serpent, and the end of them all is Death. Some tendency to these more
general conceptions of an opposing principle and power in the world
seems to be represented in that phase of development at which
nondescript forms arise. These were the conquered demons&rsquo;
bequest.</p>
<p>It is, of course, impossible to measure the various forces which
combined to produce the complex symbolical forms of physical evil.
Tradition is not always a good draughtsman, and in portraying for a
distant generation in Germany a big snake killed in India might not be
exact as to the number of its heads or other details. Heroes before
Falstaff were liable to overstate their foes in buckram. The less
measurable a thing by fact, the more immense in fancy: werewolves of
especial magnitude haunted regions where there had not been actual
wolves for centuries; huge serpents play a large part in the annals of
Ireland, where not even the smallest have been found. But after all
natural influences have been considered, one can hardly look upon the
sphynx, the chim&aelig;ra, or on a conventional dragon, without
perceiving that he is in presence of a higher creation than a demonic
bear or a giant ruffian. The fundamental difference between the two
classes is that one is natural, the other pr&aelig;ternatural. Of
course a werewolf is as pr&aelig;ternatural as a gryphon to the eye of
science, but as original expressions of human imagination the former
could hardly have been a more miraculous monster than the Siamese twins
to intelligent people to-day. The demonic forms are generally natural,
albeit caricatured or exaggerated. And this effort at a
pr&aelig;ternatural conception is, in this early form, by no means mere
superstition; rather is it poetic and artistic,&mdash;a kind of crude
effort at <i lang="de">allgemeinheit</i>, at realisation of the types
of evil&mdash;the claw-principle, fang-principle in the universe, the
physiognomies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=
"pb320">320</a>]</span>of venom and pain detached from forms to which
they are accidental.</p>
<p>Some of the particular forms we have been considering are, indeed,
by no means of the prosaic type. Such conceptions as R&aacute;hu,
Cerberus, and several others, are transitional between the natural and
mystical conceptions; while the sphynx, however complete a combination
of ideal forms, is not all demonic. In this Part III. are included
those forms whose combination is not found in objective nature, but
which are yet travesties of nature and genuine fauna of the human
mind.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be thought somewhat arbitrary that I should describe
all these intermediate forms between demon and devil by the term
<span class="sc">Dragon</span>; but I believe there is no other
fabulous form which includes so many individual types of transition, or
whose evolution may be so satisfactorily traced from the point where it
is linked with the demon to that where it bequeathes its characters to
the devil. While, however, this term is used as the best that suggests
itself, it cannot be accepted as limiting our inquiry or excluding
other abstract forms which ideally correspond to the dragon,&mdash;the
generalised expression for an active, powerful, and intelligent enemy
to mankind, a being who is antagonism organised, and able to command
every weapon in nature for an antihuman purpose.</p>
<p>The opinion has steadily gained that the conventional dragon is the
traditional form of some huge Saurian. It has been suggested that some
of those extinct forms may have been contemporaneous with the earliest
men, and that the traditions of conflicts with them, transmitted orally
and pictorially, have resulted in preserving their forms in fable
(proximately). The restorations of Saurians on their islet at the
Crystal Palace show how much common sense there is in this theory. The
discoveries of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321</a>]</span>Professor Marsh of Yale College have proved that
the general form of the dragon is startlingly prefigured in nature; and
Mr. Alfred Tylor, in an able paper read before the Anthropological
Society, has shown that we are very apt to be on the safe side in
sticking to the theory of an &lsquo;object-origin&rsquo; for most
things.</p>
<p>Concerning this theory, it may be said that the earliest
descriptions, both written and pictorial, which have been discovered of
the reptilian monsters around which grew the germs of our dragon-myths,
are crocodiles or serpents, and not dragons of any conventional
kind,&mdash;with a few doubtful exceptions. In an Egyptian papyrus
there is a hieroglyphic picture of San-nu Hut-ur, &lsquo;plunger of the
sea;&rsquo; it is a marine, dolphin-like monster, with four feet, and a
tail ending in a serpent&rsquo;s head.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5641src" href="#xd26e5641" name="xd26e5641src">1</a> With wings,
this might approach the dragon-form. Again, Amen-Ra slew <i>Naka</i>,
and this serpent &lsquo;saved his feet.&rsquo; Possibly the phrase is
ironical, and means that the serpent saved nothing; but apart from
that, the poem is too highly metaphorical&mdash;the victorious god
himself being described in it as a &lsquo;beautiful
bull&rsquo;&mdash;for the phrase to be important. On Egyptian monuments
are pictured serpents with human heads and members, and the serpent
Nahab-ka is pictured on amulets with two perfect human legs and
feet.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5647src" href="#xd26e5647" name=
"xd26e5647src">2</a> Winged serpents are found on Egyptian monuments,
but almost as frequently with the incredible number of four as with the
conceivable two wings of the pterodactyl. The forms of the serpents
thus portrayed with anthropomorphic legs and slight wings are, in their
main shapes, of ordinary species. In the Iranian tradition of the
temptation of the first man and woman, Meschia and Meschiane, by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>&lsquo;two-footed serpent of lies.&rsquo; And it
is possible that out of this myth of the &lsquo;two-footed&rsquo;
serpent grew the puzzling legend of Genesis that the serpent of Eden
was sentenced thereafter to crawl on his belly. The snake&rsquo;s lack
of feet, however, might with equal probability have given rise to the
explanation given in mussulman and rabbinical stories of his feet being
cut off by the avenging angel. But the antiquity of the Iranian myth is
doubtful; while the superior antiquity of the Hindu fable of
R&aacute;hu, to which it seems related, suggests that the two legs of
the Ahriman serpent, like the four arms of serpent-tailed R&aacute;hu,
is an anthropomorphic addition. In the ancient planispheres we find the
&lsquo;crooked serpent&rsquo; mentioned in the Book of Job, but no
dragon.</p>
<p>The two great monsters of Vedic mythology, Vritra and Ahi, are not
so distinguishable from each other in the Vedas as in more recent
fables. Vritra is very frequently called Vritra Ahi&mdash;Ahi being
explained in the St. Petersburg Dictionary as &lsquo;the Serpent of the
Heavens, the demon Vritra.&rsquo; Ahi literally means
&lsquo;serpent,&rsquo; answering to the Greek <span class="trans"
title="echi-s, echi-dna"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7952;&chi;&iota;-&sigmaf;,
&#7952;&chi;&iota;-&delta;&nu;&alpha;</span></span>; and when anything
is added it appears to be anthropomorphic&mdash;heads, arms,
eyes&mdash;as in the case of the Egyptian serpent-monsters. The Vedic
demon Urana is described as having three heads, six eyes, and
ninety-nine arms.</p>
<p>There would appear to be as little reason for ascribing to the
<i>Tannin</i> of the Old Testament the significance of dragon, though
it is generally so translated. It is used under circumstances which
show it to mean whale, serpent, and various other beasts. Jeremiah
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jer%2014:6&amp;version=NRSV">xiv.

(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=micah%201:8&amp;version=NRSV">i.
8</a>) describes their &lsquo;wailing.&rsquo; The fiery serpents said
to have afflicted Israel in the wilderness are called <i>seraphim</i>,
but neither in their natural or mythological forms do they anticipate
our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>conventional dragon beyond the fiery character
that is blended with the serpent character. Nor do the descriptions of
Behemoth and Leviathan comport with the dragon-form.</p>
<p>The serpent as an animal is a consummate development. Its feet, so
far from having been amputated, as the fables say, in punishment of its
sin, have been withdrawn beneath the skin as crutches used in a feebler
period. It is found as a tertiary fossil. Since, therefore, the dragon
form <i lang="la">ex hypothesi</i> is a reminiscence of the huge, now
fossil, Saurians which preceded the serpent in time, the early
mythologies could hardly have so regularly described great serpents
instead of dragons. If the realistic theory we are discussing were
true, the earliest combats&mdash;those of Indra, for
instance&mdash;ought to have been with dragons, and the serpent enemies
would have multiplied as time went on; but the reverse is the
case&mdash;the (alleged) extinct forms being comparatively modern in
heroic legend.</p>

<p>Mr. John Ruskin once remarked upon Turner&rsquo;s picture of the
Dragon guarding the Hesperides, that this conception so early as 1806,
when no Saurian skeleton was within the artist&rsquo;s reach, presented
a singular instance of the scientific imagination. As a coincidence
with such extinct forms Turner&rsquo;s dragon is surpassed by the
monster on which a witch rides in one of the engravings of Della Bella,
published in 1637. In that year, on the occasion of the marriage of the
grand duke Ferdinand II. in Florence, there was a masque <i lang=
"it">d&rsquo;Inferno</i>, whose representations were engraved by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>Della Bella, of which this is one, so that it
may be rather to some scenic artist than to the distinguished imitator
of Callot that we owe this grotesque form, which the late Mr. Wright
said &lsquo;might have been borrowed from some distant geological
period.&rsquo; If so, the fact would present a curious coincidence with
the true history of Turner&rsquo;s Dragon; for after Mr. Ruskin had
published his remark about the scientific imagination represented in
it, an old friend of the artist declared that Turner himself had told
him that he copied that dragon from a Christmas spectacle in Drury Lane
theatre. But Turner had shown the truest scientific instinct in
repairing to the fossil-beds of human imagination, and drawing thence
the conventional form which never had existence save as the structure
of cumulative tradition. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href=

endless extent to which the oval arches have been reproduced in the
ceramic arts of antiquity; and the same sense of symmetry which made
the Greek vase a combination of Eggs prevails in the charm which the
same graceful outline possesses wherever suggested,&mdash;as in curves
of the swan, crescent of the moon, the elongated shell,&mdash;on which
Aphrodite may well be poised, since the same contours find their

the artist and the poet. It is the one active form in nature which
cannot be ungraceful, and to estimate the extent of its use in
decoration is impossible, because all undulating and coiling lines are
necessarily serpent forms. But in addition to the perfections of this
form&mdash;which fulfil all the ascent of forms in Swedenborg&rsquo;s
mystical morphology, circular, spiral, perpetual-circular, vortical,
celestial&mdash;the Serpent bears on it, as it were, gems of the
underworld that seem to find their counterpart in galaxies.</p>

<p>One must conclude that Serpent-worship is mainly founded in fear.
The sacrifices offered to that animal are alone sufficient to prove
this. But as it is certain that the Serpent appears in symbolism and
poetry in many ways which have little or no relation to its terrors, we
may well doubt whether it may not have had a career in the human
imagination previous to either of the results of its reign of
terror,&mdash;worship and execration. It is the theory of Pestalozzi
that every child is born an artist, and through its pictorial sense
must be led on its first steps of education. The infant world displayed
also in its selection of sacred trees and animals a profound
appreciation of beauty. The myths in which the Serpent is represented
as kakodemon refer rather to its natural history than to its
appearance; and even when its natural history came to be observed,
there was&mdash;there now is&mdash;such a wide discrepancy between its
physiology and its functions, also between its intrinsic characters and
their relation to man, that we can only accept its various aspects in
mythology without attempting to trace their relative precedence in
time.</p>
<p>The past may in this case be best interpreted by the present. How
different now to wise and observant men are the suggestions of this
exceptional form in nature! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href=
"#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us read a passage concerning it from Ralph Waldo
Emerson:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the old aphorism, <i>nature is always self-similar</i>. In
the plant, the eye or germinative point opens to a leaf, then to
another leaf, with a power of transforming the leaf into radicle,
stamen, pistil, petal, bract, sepal, or seed. The whole art of the
plant is still to repeat leaf on leaf without end, the more or less of
heat, light, moisture, and food, determining the form it shall assume.
In the animal, nature makes a vertebra, or a spine of vertebr&aelig;,
and helps herself still by a new spine, with a limited power of
modifying its form,&mdash;spine on spine, to the end of the world. A
poetic anatomist, in our own day, teaches that a snake being a
horizontal line, and man being an erect line, constitute a right angle;
and between the lines of this mystical quadrant, all animated beings
find their place: and he assumes the hair-worm, the span-worm, or the
snake, as the type or prediction of the spine. Manifestly, at the end
of the spine, nature puts out smaller spines, as arms; at the end of
the arms, new spines, as hands; at the other end she repeats the
process, as legs and feet. At the top of the column she puts out
another spine, which doubles or loops itself over, as a span-worm, into
a ball, and forms the skull, with extremities again: the hands being
now the upper jaw, the feet the lower jaw, the fingers and toes being
represented this time by upper and lower teeth. This new spine is
destined to high uses. It is a new man on the shoulders of the
last.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5733src" href="#xd26e5733"
name="xd26e5733src">1</a></p>
<p>As one reads this it might be asked, How could its idealism be more
profoundly pictured for the eye than in the Serpent coiled round the
egg,&mdash;the seed out of which all these spines must branch out for
their protean variations? What refrains of ancient themes subtly sound
between the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name=
"pb328">328</a>]</span>lines,&mdash;from the Serpent doomed to crawl on
its belly in the dust, to the Serpent that is lifted up!</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the page of Jules Michelet, and read what the
Serpent signified to one mood of his sympathetic nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was one of my saddest hours when, seeking in nature a
refuge from thoughts of the age, I for the first time encountered the
head of the viper. This occurred in a valuable museum of anatomical
imitations.</p>
<p>The head marvellously imitated and enormously enlarged, so as to
remind one of the tiger&rsquo;s and the jaguar&rsquo;s, exposed in its
horrible form a something still more horrible. You seized at once the
delicate, infinite, fearfully prescient precautions by which the deadly
machine is so potently armed. Not only is it provided with numerous
keen-edged teeth, not only are these teeth supplied with an ingenious
reservoir of poison which slays immediately, but their extreme fineness
which renders them liable to fracture is compensated by an advantage
that perhaps no other animal possesses, namely, a magazine of
supernumerary teeth, to supply at need the place of any accidentally
broken. Oh, what provisions for killing! What precautions that the
victim shall not escape! What love for this horrible creature! I stood
by it <i>scandalised</i>, if I may so speak, and with a sick soul.
Nature, the great mother, by whose side I had taken refuge, shocked me
with a maternity so cruelly impartial. Gloomily I walked away, bearing
on my heart a darker shadow than rested on the day itself, one of the
sternest in winter. I had come forth like a child; I returned home like
an orphan, feeling the notion of a Providence dying away within
me.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5750src" href="#xd26e5750" name=
"xd26e5750src">2</a></p>
<p>Many have so gone forth and so returned; some to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span>say,
&lsquo;There is no God;&rsquo; a few to say (as is reported of a living
poet), &lsquo;I believe in God, but am against him;&rsquo; but some
also to discern in the viper&rsquo;s head Nature&rsquo;s ironclad,
armed with her best science to defend the advance of form to humanity
along narrow passes.</p>
<p>The primitive man was the child that went forth when his world was
also a child, and when the Serpent was still doing its part towards
making him and it a man. It was a long way from him to the
dragon-slayer; but it is much that he did not merely cower; he watched
and observed, and there is not one trait belonging to his deadly
crawling contemporaries that he did not note and spiritualise in such
science as was possible to him.</p>
<p>The last-discovered of the topes in India represents
Serpent-worshippers gathered around their deity, holding their tongues
with finger and thumb. No living form in nature could be so fitly
regarded in that attitude. Not only is the Serpent normally silent, but
in its action it has &lsquo;the quiet of perfect motion.&rsquo; The
maximum of force is shown in it, relatively to its size, along with the
minimum of friction and visible effort. Footless, wingless, as a star,
its swift gliding and darting is sometimes like the lightning whose
forked tongue it seemed to incarnate. The least touch of its ingenious
tooth is more destructive than the lion&rsquo;s jaw. What mystery in
its longevity, in its self-subsistence, in its self-renovation! Out of
the dark it comes arrayed in jewels, a crawling magazine of death in
its ire, in its unknown purposes able to renew its youth, and fable for
man imperishable life! Wonderful also are its mimicries. It sometimes
borrows colours of the earth on which it reposes, the trees on which it
hangs, now seems covered with eyes, and the &lsquo;spectacled
snake&rsquo; appeared to have artificially added to its vision.
Altogether it is unique among natural forms, and its vast <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=

does credit to the observation of primitive man.</p>
<p>Recent experiments have shown the monkeys stand in the greatest
terror of snakes. Such terror is more and more recognised as a survival
in the European man. The Serpent is almost the only animal which can
follow a monkey up a tree and there attack its young. Our arboreal
anthropoid progenitors could best have been developed in some place
naturally enclosed and fortified, as by precipices which quadrupeds
could not scale, but which apes might reach by swinging and leaping
from trees. But there could be no seclusion where the Serpent could not
follow. I am informed by the King of Bonny that in his region of Africa
the only serpent whose worship is fully maintained is the <i>Nomboh</i>
(Leaper), a small snake, white and glistening, whose bite is fatal, and
which, climbing into trees, springs thence upon its prey beneath, and
can travel far by leaping from branch to branch. The first arboreal man
who added a little to the natural defences of any situation might stand
in tradition as a god planting a garden; but even he would not be
supposed able to devise any absolute means of defence against the
subtlest of all the beasts. Among the three things Solomon found too
wonderful for him was &lsquo;the way of a serpent upon a rock&rsquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=prov%2030:19&amp;version=NRSV">Prov.
xxx. 19</a>). This comparative superiority of the Serpent to any and
all devices and contrivances known to primitive men&mdash;whose
proverbs must have made most of Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom&mdash;would
necessarily have its effect upon the animal and mental nerves of our
race in early times, and the Serpent would find in his sanctity a
condition favourable to survival and multiplication. It is this fatal
power of superstition to change fancies into realities which we find
still protecting the Serpent in various countries. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span>From
being venerated as the arbiter of life and death, it might thus
actually become such in large districts of country. In Dubufe&rsquo;s
picture of the Fall of Man, the wrath of Jehovah is represented by the
lightning, which has shattered the tree beneath which the offending
pair are now crouching; beyond it Satan is seen in human shape raising
his arm in proud defiance against the blackened sky. So would the
Serpent appear. His victims were counted by many thousands where the
lightning laid low one. Transmitted along the shuddering nerves of many
generations came the confession of the Son of Sirach, &lsquo;There is
no head above the head of a serpent.&rsquo; <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the eve of January 1, 1863,&mdash;that historic New
Year&rsquo;s Day on which President Lincoln proclaimed freedom to
American slaves,&mdash;I was present at a Watchnight held by negroes in
a city of that country. In opening the meeting the preacher
said,&mdash;though in words whose eloquent shortcomings I cannot
reproduce:&mdash;&lsquo;Brethren and sisters, the President of the
United States has promised that, if the Confederates do not lay down
their arms, he will free all their slaves to-morrow. They have not laid
down their arms. To-morrow will be the day of liberty to the oppressed.
But we all know that evil powers are around the President. While we sit
here they are trying to make him break his word. But we have come
together to watch, and see that he does not break his word. Brethren,
the bad influences around the President to-night are stronger than any
Copperheads.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5788src" href="#xd26e5788"
name="xd26e5788src">1</a> The Old Serpent is abroad to-night, with all
his emissaries, in great power. His wrath is great, because he knows
his hour is near. He will be in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333"
href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>this church this evening. As
midnight comes on we shall hear his rage. But, brethren and sisters,
don&rsquo;t be alarmed. Our prayers will prevail. His head will be
bruised. His back will be broken. He will go raging to hell, and God
Almighty&rsquo;s New Year will make the United States a true land of
freedom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sensation caused among the hundreds of negroes present by these
words was profound; they were frequently interrupted by cries of
&lsquo;Glory!&rsquo; and there were tears of joy. But the scene and
excitement which followed were indescribable. A few moments before
midnight the congregation were requested to kneel, which they did, and
prayer succeeded prayer with increasing fervour. Presently a loud,
prolonged hiss was heard. There were cries&mdash;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s
here! he&rsquo;s here!&rsquo; Then came a volley of hisses; they seemed
to proceed from every part of the room, hisses so entirely like those
of huge serpents that the strongest nerves were shaken; above them rose
the preacher&rsquo;s prayer that had become a wild incantation, and
ecstatic ejaculations became so universal that it was a marvel what
voices were left to make the hisses. Finally, from a neighbouring
steeple the twelve strokes of midnight sounded on the frosty air, and
immediately the hisses diminished, and presently died away altogether,
and the New Year that brought freedom to four millions of slaves was
ushered in by the jubilant chorus of all present singing a hymn of
victory.</p>
<p>Far had come those hisses and that song of victory, terminating the
dragon-drama of America. In them was the burden of Ezekiel: &lsquo;Son
of man, set thy face against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and prophesy
against him and against all Egypt, saying, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah:
Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that
lieth in the midst of the rivers &hellip; I will put a hook in thy
jaws.&rsquo; In them was the burden of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb334" href="#pb334" name="pb334">334</a>]</span>Isaiah: &lsquo;In
that day Jehovah with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish
Leviathan the piercing serpent, even Leviathan that crooked serpent: he
shall slay the dragon that is in the sea.&rsquo; In it was the cry of
Zophar: &lsquo;His meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps
within him. He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up
again: God shall cast them out of his belly.&rsquo; And these Hebrew
utterances, again, were but the distant echoes of far earlier voices of
those African slaves still seen pictured with their chains on the
ruined walls of Egypt,&mdash;voices that gathered courage at last to
announce the never-ending struggle of man with Oppression, as that
combat between god and serpent which never had a nobler event than when
the dying hiss of Slavery was heard in America, and the victorious Sun
rose upon a New World of free and equal men.</p>
<p>The Serpent thus exalted in America to a type of oppression is very
different from any snake that may this day be found worshipped as a
deity by the African in his native land. The swarthy snake-worshipper
in his migration took his god along with him in his chest or
basket&mdash;at once ark and altar&mdash;and in that hiding-place it
underwent transformations. He emerged as the protean emblem of both
good and evil. In a mythologic sense the serpent certainly held its
tail in its mouth. No civilisation has reached the end of its typical
supremacy.</p>

</div>
<p>Concerning the accompanying Eleusinian form (<a href="#fig24">Fig.
24</a>), Calmet says:&mdash;&lsquo;The mysterious trunk, coffer, or
basket, may be justly reckoned among the most remarkable and sacred
instruments of worship, which formed part of the processional
ceremonies in the heathen world. This was held so sacred that it was
not publicly exposed to view, or publicly opened, but was reserved for
the inspection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>of the initiated, the fully initiated only.
Completely to explain this symbol would require a dissertation; and,
indeed, it has been considered, more or less, by those who have written
on the nature of the Ark of the testimony among the Hebrews. Declining
the inquiry at present, we merely call the attention of the reader to
what this mystical coffer was supposed to contain&mdash;a
serpent!&rsquo; The French Benedictine who wrote this passage, though
his usual candour shames the casuistry of our own time, found it
necessary to conceal the Hebrew Ark: it was precisely so that the
occupant of the Ark was originally concealed; and though St. John
exorcised it from the Chalice its genius lingers in the Pyx, before
whose Host &lsquo;lifted up&rsquo; the eyes of worshippers are
lowered.</p>
<p>The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews (chap. ix.), describing the
Tabernacle, says: &lsquo;After the second veil, the tabernacle which is
called the Holiest of all; which had the golden censer, and the ark of
the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
that had manna, and Aaron&rsquo;s rod that budded, and the tables of
the covenant.&rsquo; But this rod of Aaron, which, by budding, had
swallowed up all rival pretensions to the tribal priesthood, was the
same rod which had been changed to a serpent, and swallowed up the
rod-serpents of the sorcerers in Pharaoh&rsquo;s presence. So soft and
subtle is &lsquo;the way of a serpent upon a rock!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This veiling of the Serpent, significant of a great deal, is
characteristic even of the words used to name it. Of these I have
selected one to head this chapter, because it is one of the innumerable
veils which shielded this reptile&rsquo;s transformation from a
particular external danger to a demonic type. This general description
of things that wind about or turn (<i>vermes</i>, traced by some to the
Sanskrit root <i>hvar</i>, &lsquo;curved&rsquo;), gradually came into
use to express the demon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href=
"#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>serpents. Dante and Milton call
Satan a worm. No doubt among the two hundred names for the Serpent,
said to be mentioned in an Arabic work, we should find parallels to
this old adaptation of the word &lsquo;worm.&rsquo; In
countries&mdash;as Germany and England&mdash;where no large serpents
are found, the popular imagination could not be impressed by merely
saying that Siegfried or Lambton had slain a snake. The tortuous
character of the snake was preserved, but, by that unconscious
dexterity which so often appears in the making of myths, it was
expanded so as to include a power of supernatural transformation. The
Lambton worm comes out of the well very small, but it afterwards coils
in nine huge folds around its hill. The hag-ridden daughter of the King
of Northumberland, who</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd26e4001">crept into a hole a worm</p>
<p class="line">And out stept a fair ladye,</p>
</div>
<p class="first">did but follow the legendary rule of the demonic
serpent tribe.</p>
<p>Why was the Serpent slipped into the Ark or coffer and hid behind
veils? To answer this will require here an episode.</p>
<p>In the Etruscan theology and ceremonial the supreme power was lodged
with certain deities that were never seen. They were called the
<i lang="la">Dii Involuti</i>, the veiled gods. Not even the priests
ever looked upon them. When any dire calamity occurred, it was said
these mysterious deities had spoken their word in the council of the
gods,&mdash;a word always final and fatal.</p>
<p>There have been fine theories on the subject, and the Etruscans have
been complimented for having high transcendental views of the invisible
nature of the Divine Being. But a more prosaic theory is probably true.
These gods were wrapped up because they were not fit to be seen. The
rude carvings of some savage tribe, they had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>seen
and adored at first: temples had been built for them, and their
priesthood had grown powerful; but as art advanced and beautiful
statues arose, these rude designs could not bear the contrast, and the
only way of preserving reverence for them, and the institutions grown
up around them, was to hide them out of sight altogether. Then it could
be said they were so divinely beautiful that the senses would be
overpowered by them.</p>
<p>There have been many veiled deities, and though their veils have
been rationalised, they are easily pierced. The inscription on the
temple of Isis at Sais was: &lsquo;I am that which has been, which is,
and which shall be, and no one has yet lifted the veil that hides
me.&rsquo; Isis at this time had probably become a negro Madonna, like
that still worshipped in Spain as holiest of images, and called by the
same title, &lsquo;Our Immaculate Lady.&rsquo; As the fair race and the
dark mingled in Egypt, the primitive Nubian complexion and features of
Isis could not inspire such reverence as more anciently, and before her
also a curtain was hung. The Ark of Moses carried this veil into the
wilderness, and concealed objects not attractive to look
at&mdash;probably two scrawled stones, some bones said to be those of
Joseph, a pot of so-called manna, and the staff said to have once been
a serpent and afterwards blossomed. Fashioned by a rude tribe, the Ark
was a fit thing to hide, and hidden it has been to this day. When the
veil of the Temple was rent,&mdash;allegorically at the death of
Christ, actually by Titus,&mdash;nothing of the kind was found; and it
would seem that the Jews must long have been worshipping before a veil
with emptiness behind it. Paul discovered that the veil said to have
covered the face of Moses when he descended from Sinai was a myth; it
meant that the people should not see to the end of what was
nevertheless transient. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href=
"#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span>&lsquo;Their minds were blinded;
for unto this day, when Moses is read, that veil is on their
heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kircher says the Seraphs of Egypt were images without any eminency
of limbs, rolled as it were in swaddling clothes, partly made of stone,
partly of metal, wood, or shell. Similar images, he says, were called
by the Romans &lsquo;secret gods.&rsquo; As an age of scepticism
advanced, it was sometimes necessary that these &lsquo;<span lang=
"la">involuti</span>&rsquo; should be slightly revealed, lest it should
be said there was no god there at all. Such is the case with the famous
<i lang="it">bambino</i> of Arac&oelig;li Church in Rome. This effigy,
said to have been carved by a pilgrim out of a tree on the Mount of
Olives, and painted by St. Luke while the pilgrim was sleeping, is now
kept in its ark, and visitors are allowed to see part of its painted
face. When the writer of this requested a sight of the whole form, or
of the head at any rate, the exhibiting priest was astounded at the
suggestion. No doubt he was right: the only wonder is that the face is
not hid also, for a more ingeniously ugly thing than the flat,
blackened, and rouged visage of the bambino it were difficult to
conceive. But it wears a very cunning veil nevertheless. The face is
set in marvellous brilliants, but these are of less effect in hiding
its ugliness than the vesture of mythology around it. The adjacent
walls are covered with pictures of the miracles it has performed, and
which have attracted to it such faith that it is said at one time to
have received more medical fees than all the physicians in Rome
together. Priests have discovered that a veil over the mind is thicker
than a veil on the god. Such is the popular veneration for the bambino,
that, in 1849, the Republicans thought it politic to present the monks
with the Pope&rsquo;s state coach to carry the idol about. In the end
it was proved that the Pope was securely seated beside <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>the
bambino, and he presently emerged from behind his veil also.</p>
<p>There came, then, a period when the Serpent crept behind the veil,
or lid of the ark, or into a chalice,&mdash;a very small worm, but yet
able to gnaw the staff of Solomon. No wisdom could be permitted to rise
above fear itself, though its special sources might be here and there
reduced or vanquished. The snake had taught man at last its arts of
war. Man had summoned to his aid the pig, and the ibis made havoc among
the reptiles; and some of that terror which is the parent of that kind
of devotion passed away. When it next emerged, it was in twofold
guise,&mdash;as Agathodemon and Kakodemon,&mdash;but in both forms as
the familiar of some higher being. It was as the genius of Minerva, of
Esculapius, of St. Euphemia. We have already seen him (<a href=
"#fig13">Fig. 13</a>) as the genius of the Eleans, the Sosopolis, where
also we see the Serpent hurrying into his cavern, leaving the mother
and child to be worshipped in the temple of Lucina. In Christian
symbolism the Seraphim&mdash;&lsquo;burning (<i>s&aacute;raf</i>)
serpents&rsquo;&mdash;veiled their faces and forms beneath their huge
wings, crossed in front, and so have been able to become &lsquo;the
eminent,&rsquo; and to join in the praises of modern communities at
being delivered from just such imaginary fiery worms as themselves!

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The considerations advanced in the previous chapter
enable us to dismiss with facility many of the rationalistic
interpretations which have been advanced to explain the monstrous
serpents of sacred books by reference to imaginary species supposed to
be now extinct. Flying serpents, snakes many-headed, rain-bringing,
woman-hating, &amp;c., may be suffered to survive as the fauna of
bibliolatrous imaginations. Such forms, however, are of such mythologic
importance that it is necessary to watch carefully against this method
of realistic interpretation, especially as there are many actual
characteristics of serpents sufficiently mysterious to conspire with
it. A recent instance of this literalism may here be noticed.</p>
<p>Mr. W. R. Cooper<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5883src" href=
"#xd26e5883" name="xd26e5883src">1</a> supposes the evil serpent of
Egyptian Mythology to have a real basis in &lsquo;a large and
unidentified species of coluber, of great strength and hideous
longitude,&rsquo; which &lsquo;was, even from the earliest ages,
associated as the representative of spiritual, and occasionally
physical evil, and was named Hof, Rehof, or Apophis,<span class="corr"
id="xd26e5886" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span> the
&lsquo;<i>destroyer</i>, the <i>enemy of the gods</i>, and the
<i>devourer</i> of the souls of men.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>That
such a creature, he adds, &lsquo;once inhabited the Libyan desert, we
have the testimony of both Hanno the Carthaginian and Lucan the Roman,
and if it is now no longer an inhabitant of that region, it is probably
owing to the advance of civilisation having driven it farther
south.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Apart from the extreme improbability that African exploration should
have brought no rumours of such a monster if it existed, it may be said
concerning Mr. Cooper&rsquo;s theory: (1.) If, indeed, the references
cited were to a reptile now unknown, we might be led by mythologic
analogy to expect that it would have been revered beyond either the Asp
or the Cobra. In proportion to the fear has generally been the
exaltation of its objects. Primitive peoples have generally gathered
courage to pour invective upon evil monsters when&mdash;either from
their non-existence or rarity&mdash;there was least danger of its being
practically resented as a personal affront. (2.) The regular folds of
Apophis on the sarcophagus of Seti I. and elsewhere are so evidently
mystical and conventional that, apparently, they refer to a
serpent-form only as the guilloche on a wall may refer to sea-waves.
Apophis (or Apap) would have been a decorative artist to fold himself
in such order.</p>
<p>These impossible labyrinthine coils suggest Time, as the serpent
with its tail in its mouth signifies Eternity,&mdash;an evolution of
the same idea. This was the interpretation given by a careful scholar,
the late William Hickson,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5905src" href=
"#xd26e5905" name="xd26e5905src">2</a> to the procession of nine
persons depicted on the sarcophagus mentioned as bearing a serpent,
each holding a fold, all being regular enough for a frieze. &lsquo;The
scene,&rsquo; says this author, &lsquo;appears to relate to the Last
Judgment, for Osiris is seen on his throne, passing sentence on a crowd
before him; and in the same tableaux are depicted the river that
divides the living from the dead, and the bridge <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name="pb342">342</a>]</span>of
life. The death of the serpent may possibly be intended to symbolise
the end of time.&rsquo; This idea of long duration might be a general
one relating to all time, or it might refer to the duration of
individual life; it involved naturally the evils and agonies of life;
but the fundamental conception is more simple, and also more poetic,
than even these implications, and it means eternal waste and decay. One
has need only to sit before a clock to see Apophis: there coil upon
coil winds the ever-moving monster, whose tooth is remorseless,
devouring little by little the strength and majesty of man, and
reducing his grandest achievements&mdash;even his universe&mdash;to
dust. Time is the undying Worm.</p>

<p>The natural history of Apophis, so far as he has any, is probably
suggested in the following passage cited by Mr. Cooper from
Wilkinson:&mdash;&lsquo;&AElig;lian relates many strange stories of the
asp, and the respect paid to it by the Egyptians; but we may suppose
that in his sixteen species of asps other snakes were included. He also
speaks of a dragon which was sacred in the Egyptian Melite, and another
kind of snake called Paries or Paruas, dedicated to &AElig;sculapius.
The serpent of Melite had priests and ministers, a table and bowl. It
was kept in a tower, and fed by the priests with cakes made of flour
and honey, which they placed there in a bowl. Having done this they
retired. The next day, on returning to the apartment, the food was
found to be eaten, and the same quantity was again put into the bowl,
for it was not lawful for any one to see the sacred
reptile.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5975src" href="#xd26e5975"
name="xd26e5975src">4</a></p>
<p>It was in this concealment from the outward eye that the Serpent was
able to assume such monstrous proportions to the eye of imagination;
and, indeed, it is not beyond conjecture that this serpent of Melite,
coming in conflict with Osirian worship, was degraded and demonised
into that evil monster (Apophis) whom Horus slew to avenge his
destruction of Osiris (for he was often identified with Typhon).</p>
<p>Though Horus cursed and slew this terrible demon-serpent, he
reappears in all Egyptian Mythology with undiminished strength, and all
evil powers were the brood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href=
"#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span>of himself or Typhon, who were
sometimes described as brothers and sometimes as the same beings. From
the &lsquo;Ritual of the Dead&rsquo; we learn that it was the high
privilege and task of the heroic dead to be reconstructed and go forth
to encounter and subdue the agents of Apophis, who sent out to engage
them the crocodiles Seb, Hem, and Shui, and other crocodiles from
north, south, east, and west; the hero having conquered these, acquires
their might, and next prevails over the walking viper Ru; and so on
with other demons called &lsquo;precursors of Apophis,&rsquo; until
their prince himself is encountered and slain, all the hero&rsquo;s
guardian deities attending to fix a knife in each of the
monster&rsquo;s folds. These are the Vanquishers of Time,&mdash;the
immortal.</p>
<p>In Apophis we find the Serpent fairly developed to a principle of
evil. He is an &lsquo;accuser of the sun;&rsquo; the twelve gateways
into Hades are surmounted by his representatives, which the Sun must
pass&mdash;twelve hours of night. He is at once the &lsquo;Nachash
beriach&rsquo; and &lsquo;Nachash aktalon&rsquo;&mdash;the
&lsquo;Cross-bar serpent&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Tortuous
serpent&rsquo;&mdash;which we meet with in <a class="biblink xd26e43"

Isa. xxvii. 1</a>: &lsquo;In that day the Lord with his sore and great
and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even
leviathan that crooked serpent.&rsquo; The marginal translation in the
English version is &lsquo;crossing like a bar,&rsquo; instead of
piercing, and the Vulgate has <i lang="la">serpens vectis</i>. This
refers to the moral function of the serpent, as barring the way, or
guarding the door. No doubt this is the &lsquo;crooked serpent&rsquo;
of <a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

Job xxvi. 13</a>, for the astrological sense of it does not invalidate
the terrestrial significance. Imagination could only project into the
heavens what it had learned on earth. Bochart in identifying
&lsquo;Nachash-beriach&rsquo; as &lsquo;the flying Serpent,&rsquo; is
quite right: the Seraph, or winged Serpent, which barred the way to the
tree of life in Eden, and in some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345"
href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>traditions was the
treacherous guard at the gate of the garden, and which bit Israel in
the wilderness, was this same protean Apophis. For such tasks, and to
soar into the celestial planisphere, the Serpent must needs have wings;
and thus it is already far on its way to become the flying Dragon. But
in one form, as the betrayer of man, it must lose its wings and crawl
upon the ground for ever. The Serpent is thus not so much agathodemon
and kakodemon in one form, as a principle of destructiveness which is
sometimes employed by the deity to punish his enemies, as Horus employs
fiery Kheti, but sometimes requires to be himself punished.</p>
<p>There have been doubts whether the familiar derivation of
<span class="trans" title="ophis"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#8004;&phi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span></span>, serpent, from
<span class="trans" title="ops"><span class="Greek" lang=

the Greek word with <span class="trans" title="echis"><span class=
"Greek" lang="grc">&#7956;&chi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span></span>, but
Curtius maintains that the old derivation from <span class="trans"
title="ops"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&#8004;&psi;</span></span>
is correct.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6041src" href="#xd26e6041" name=
"xd26e6041src">5</a> Even were this not the etymology, the popularity
of it would equally suggest the fact that this reptile was of old
supposed to kill with its glance; and it was also generally regarded as
gifted with pr&aelig;ternatural vision. By a similar process to that
which developed avenging Furies out of the detective
dawn&mdash;<span class="corr" id="xd26e6045" title=
"Source: Erinys">Erinyes</span> from Saranyu, Satan from
Lucifer<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6048src" href="#xd26e6048" name=
"xd26e6048src">6</a>&mdash;this subtle Spy might have become also a
retributive and finally a malignant power. The Furies were portrayed
bearing serpents in their hands, and each of these might carry ideally
the terrors of Apophis: Time also is a detective, and the guilty heard
it saying, &lsquo;Your sin will find you out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Through many associations of this kind the Serpent became at an
early period an agent of ordeal. Any one handling it with impunity was
regarded as in league with it, or specially hedged about by the deity
whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span>&lsquo;hands formed the crooked serpent.&rsquo;
It may have been as snake-charmers that Moses and Aaron appeared before
Pharaoh and influenced his imagination; or, if the story be a myth, its
existence still shows that serpent performances would then have been
regarded as credentials of divine authentication. So when Paul was
shipwrecked on Malta, where a viper is said to have fastened on his
hand, the barbarians, having at first inferred that he was a murderer,
&lsquo;whom though he hath escaped the sea, yet Vengeance suffereth not
to live,&rsquo; concluded he was a god when they found him unharmed.
Innumerable traditions preceded the words ascribed to Christ (<a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2010:19&amp;version=NRSV">Luke
x. 19</a>), &lsquo;Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents
and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall
by any means hurt you.&rsquo; It is instructive to compare this
sentence attributed to Christ with the notion of the barbarians
concerning Paul&rsquo;s adventure, whatever it may have been.
Paul&rsquo;s familiarity with the Serpent seems to them proof that he
is a god. Such also is the idea represented in <a class=
"biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa%209:8&amp;version=NRSV">
Isa. xi. 8</a>, &lsquo;The sucking child shall play on the hole of the
asp.&rsquo; But the idea of treading on serpents marks a period more
nearly corresponding to that of the infant Hercules strangling the
serpents. Yet though these two conceptions&mdash;serpent-treading, and
serpent-slaying&mdash;approach each other, they are very different in
source and significance, both morally and historically. The word used
in Luke, <span class="trans" title="pateiin"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&pi;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon;&iota;&#8150;&nu;</span></span>, conveys
the idea of walking over something in majesty, not in hostility; it
must be interpreted by the next sentence (<a class="biblink xd26e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2010:20&amp;version=NRSV">x.

are subject unto you (<span class="trans" title=

&pi;&nu;&epsilon;&#8059;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;
&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&tau;&#8049;&sigma;&sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;</span></span>).&rsquo;
The serpent-slayer or dragon-slayer is not of Semitic origin. The awful
supremacy of Jehovah held all the powers of destruction chained to his
hand; and to ask man if he could draw out <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>Leviathan with a hook
was only another form of reminding him of his own inferiority to the
creator and lord of Leviathan. How true the Semitic ideas running
<span class="corr" id="xd26e6083" title="Source: though">through</span>
the Bible, and especially represented in the legend of Paul in Malta,
are to the barbarian nature is illustrated by an incident related in
Mr. Brinton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Myths of the New World.&rsquo; The pious
founder of the Moravian Brotherhood, Count Zinzendorf, was visiting a
missionary station among the Shawnees in the Wyoming Valley, America.
Recent quarrels with the white people had so irritated the red men that
they resolved to make him their victim. After he had retired to his hut
several of the braves softly peered in. Count Zinzendorf was seated
before a fire, lost in perusal of the Scriptures; and while the red men
gazed they saw what he did not&mdash;a huge rattlesnake trailing across
his feet to gather itself in a coil before the comfortable warmth of
the fire. Immediately they forsook their murderous purpose, and retired
noiselessly, convinced that this was indeed a divine man. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That Serpent-worship in India was developed by
euphemism seems sufficiently shown in the famous Vedic hymn called
<i>Kankato na</i>, recited as an antidote against all venom, of which
the following is a translation:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;1. Some creature of little venom; some creature of great
venom; or some venomous aquatic reptile; creatures of two kinds, both
destructive of life, or poisonous, unseen creatures, have anointed me
with their poison.</p>
<p>&lsquo;2. The antidote coming to the bitten person destroys the
unseen venomous creatures; departing it destroys them; deprived of
substance it destroys them by its odour; being ground it pulverises
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;3. Blades of <i>sara</i> grass, of <i>kusara</i>, of
<i>darhba</i>, of <i>sairya</i>, of <i>munja</i>, of <i>virana</i>, all
the haunt of unseen venomous creatures, have together anointed me with
their venom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4. The cows had lain down in their stalls; the wild beasts
had retreated to their lairs; the senses of men were at rest; when the
unseen venomous creatures anointed me with their venom. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;5. Or they may be discovered in the dark, as thieves in the
dusk of evening; for although they be unseen yet all are seen by them;
therefore, men be vigilant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;6. Heaven, serpents, is your father; Earth, your mother;
Soma, your brother; Aditi, your sister; unseen, all-seeing, abide in
your holes; enjoy your own good pleasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;7. Those who move with their shoulders, those who move with
their bodies, those who sting with sharp fangs, those who are
virulently venomous; what do ye here, ye unseen, depart together far
from us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;8. The all-seeing Sun rises in the East, the destroyer of the
unseen, driving away all the unseen venomous creatures, and all evil
spirits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;9. The Sun has risen on high, destroying all the many
poisons; Aditya, the all-seeing, the destroyer of the unseen, rises for
the good of living beings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;10. I deposit the poison in the solar orb, like a leathern
bottle in the house of a vendor of spirits; verily that adorable Sun
never dies; nor through his favour shall we die of the venom; for,
though afar off, yet drawn by his coursers he will overtake the poison:
the science of antidotes converted thee, Poison, to ambrosia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;11. That insignificant little bird has swallowed thy venom;
she does not die; nor shall we die; for although afar off, yet, drawn
by his coursers, the Sun will overtake the poison: the science of
antidotes has converted thee, Poison, to ambrosia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;12. May the thrice-seven sparks of Agni consume the influence
of the venom; they verily do not perish; nor shall we die; for although
afar off, the Sun, drawn by his coursers, will overtake the poison: the
science of antidotes has converted thee, Poison, to ambrosia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;13. I recite the names of ninety and nine rivers, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href="#pb350" name=
"pb350">350</a>]</span>destroyers of poison: although afar off, the
Sun, drawn by his coursers, will overtake the poison: the science of
antidotes will convert thee, Poison, to ambrosia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;14. May the thrice-seven peahens, the seven-sister rivers,
carry off, O Body, thy poison, as maidens with pitchers carry away
water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;15. May the insignificant mungoose carry off thy venom,
Poison: if not, I will crush the vile creature with a stone: so may the
poison depart from my body, and go to distant regions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;16. Hastening forth at the command of Agastya, thus spake the
mungoose: The venom of the scorpion is innocuous; Scorpion, thy venom
is innocuous.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6156src" href=
"#xd26e6156" name="xd26e6156src">1</a></p>
<p>Though, in the sixth verse of this hymn, the serpents are said to be
born of Heaven and Earth, the context does not warrant the idea that
any homage to them is intended; they are associated with the evil
Rakshasas, the Sun and Agni being represented as their haters and
destroyers. The seven-sister rivers (streams of the sacred Ganges)
supply an antidote to their venom, and certain animals, the partridge
and the mungoose, are said, though insignificant, to be their
superiors. The science of antidotes alluded to is that which Indra
taught to Dadhyanch, who lost his head for communicating it to the
Aswins. It is notable, however, that in the Vedic period there is
nothing which represents the serpent as medicinal, unless by a
roundabout process we connect the expression in the Rig-Veda that the
wrath of the Maruts, or storm-gods, is &lsquo;as the ire of
serpents,&rsquo; with the fact that their chief, Rudra, is celebrated
as the bestower of &lsquo;healing herbs,&rsquo; and they themselves
solicited for &lsquo;medicaments.&rsquo; This would be stretching the
sense of the hymns too far. It is quite possible, however, that at a
later day, when serpent-worship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351"
href="#pb351" name="pb351">351</a>]</span>was fully developed in India,
what is said in the sixth verse of the hymn may have been adduced to
confirm the superstition.</p>
<p>It seems clear, then, that at the time the <i>Kankato na</i> was
written, the serpent was regarded with simple abhorrence. And we may
remember, also, that even now, when the Indian cobra is revered as a
Brahman of the highest caste, there is a reminiscence of his previous
ill repute preserved in the common Hindu belief that a certain mark on
his head was left there by the heel of Vishnu, Lord of Life, who trod
on it when, in one of his avatars, he first stepped upon the earth.
Although in the later mythology we find Vishnu, in the intervals
between his avatars or incarnations, reposing on a serpent
(<i>Sesha</i>), this might originally have signified only his lordship
over it, though Sesha is also called <i>Ananta</i>, the Infinite. The
idea of the Infinite is a late one, however, and the symbolisation of
it by Sesha is consistent with a lower significance at first. In Hindu
popular fables the snake appears in its simple character. Such is the
fable of which so many variants are found, the most familiar in the
West being that of Bethgelert, and which is the thirteenth of the 4th
Hitopadesa. The Brahman having left his child alone, while he performs
a rite to his ancestors, on his return finds a pet mungoose (nakula)
smeared with blood. Supposing the mungoose has devoured his child, he
slays it, and then discovers that the poor animal had killed a serpent
which had crept upon the infant. In the <i>Kankato na</i> the word
interpreted by S&aacute;yana as mungoose (<i>Viverra Mungo</i>, or
ichneumon) is not the same (<i>nakula</i>), but it evidently means some
animal sufficiently unimportant to cast contempt upon the Serpent.</p>
<p>The universality of the Serpent as emblem of the healing
art&mdash;found as such among the <span class="corr" id="xd26e6187"
title="Source: Egytians">Egyptians</span>, Greeks, Germans, Aztecs, and
natives of Brazil&mdash;suggests that its longevity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name="pb352">352</a>]</span>and
power of casting its old skin, apparently renewing its youth, may have
been the basis of this reputation. No doubt, also, they would have been
men of scientific tendencies and of close observation who first learned
the snake&rsquo;s susceptibilities to music, and how its poison might
be drawn, or even its fangs, and who so gained reputation as partakers
of its supposed powers. Through such primitive rationalism the Serpent
might gain an important alliance and climb to make the asp-crown of
Isis as goddess of health (the Thermuthis), to twine round the staff of
Esculapius, to be emblem of Hippocrates, and ultimately survive to be
the sign of the European leech, twining at last as a red stripe round
the barber&rsquo;s pole. The primitive zoologist and snake-charmer
would not only, in all likelihood, be a man cunning in the secrets of
nature, but he would study to meet as far as he could the popular
demand for palliatives and antidotes against snake-bites; all who
escaped death after such wounds would increase his credit as a
practitioner; and even were his mitigations necessarily few, his
knowledge of the Serpent&rsquo;s habits and of its varieties might be
the source of valuable precautions.</p>
<p>Such probable facts as these must, of course, be referred to a
period long anterior to the poetic serpent-symbolism of Egypt, and the
elaborate Serpent mythology of Greece and Scandinavia. How simple
ideas, having once gained popular prestige, may be caught up by
theologians, poets, metaphysicians, and quacks, and modified into
manifold forms, requires no proof in an age when we are witnessing the
rationalistic interpretations by which the cross, the sacraments, and
the other plain symbols are invested with all manner of philosophical
meanings. The Serpent having been adopted as the sign-post of Egyptian
and Assyrian doctors&mdash;and it may have been something of that kind
that was set up by Moses in the wilderness&mdash;would naturally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>become the symbol of life, and after that it
would do duty in any capacity whatever.</p>
<p>An ingenious anthropologist, Mr. C. Staniland Wake,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6198src" href="#xd26e6198" name="xd26e6198src">2</a>
supposes the Serpent in India to have been there also the symbol of
pr&aelig;ternatural and occult knowledge. Possibly this may have been
so to a limited extent, and in post-Vedic times, but to me the accent
of Hindu serpent-mythology appears to be emphatically in the homage
paid to it as the guardian of the treasures. I may mention here also
the theory propounded by Miss A. W. Buckland in a paper submitted to
the Anthropological Institute in London, March 10, 1874, on &lsquo;The
Serpent in connection with Primitive Metallurgy.&rsquo; In this learned
monograph the writer maintains that a connection may be observed
between the early serpent-worship and a knowledge of metals, and indeed
that the Serpent was the sign of Turanian metallurgists in the same way
as I have suggested that in Egypt and Assyria it was the sign of
physicians. She believes that the Serpent must have played some part in
the original discovery of the metals and precious stones by man, in
recognition of which that animal was first assumed as a totem and
thence became an emblem. She states that traditional and
ornamentational evidences show that the Turanian races were the first
workers in metals, and that they migrated westward, probably from India
to Egypt and Chald&aelig;a, and thence to Europe, and even to America,
bearing their art and its sign; and that they fled before the Aryans,
who had the further art of smelting, and that the Aryan myths of
serpent-slaying record the overthrow of the Turanian
serpent-worshippers.</p>
<p>I cannot think that Miss Buckland has made out a case for crediting
nomadic Turanians with being the original <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>metallurgists; though
it is not impossible that it may have been a Scythian tribe in Southern
India who gave its fame to &lsquo;the gold of Ophir,&rsquo; which Max
M&uuml;ller has shown to have been probably an Indian region.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6208src" href="#xd26e6208" name="xd26e6208src">3</a>
But that these early jewellers may have had the Serpent as their sign
or emblem is highly probable, and in explanation of it there seems
little reason to resort to the hypothesis of aid having been given by
the Serpent to man in his discovery of metals. Surely the jewelled
decoration of the serpent would in itself have been an obvious
suggestion of it as the emblem of gems. Where a reptile for some
reasons associated with the snake&mdash;the toad&mdash;had not the like
bright spots, the cognate superstition might arise that its jewel is
concealed in its head. And, finally, when these reptiles had been
connected with gems, the eye of either would easily receive added rays
from manifold eye-beams of superstition.</p>
<p>We might also credit the primitive people with sufficient logical
power to understand why they should infer that an animal so wonderfully
and elaborately provided with deadliness as the Serpent should have
tasks of corresponding importance. The medicine which healed man
(therefore possibly gods), the treasures valued most by men (therefore
by anthropomorphic deities), the fruit of immortality (which the gods
might wish to monopolise),&mdash;might seem the supreme things of
value, which the supreme perfection of the serpent&rsquo;s fang might
be created to guard. This might be so in the heavens as well as in the
world or the underworld. The rainbow was called the &lsquo;Celestial
Serpent&rsquo; in Persia, and the old notion that there is a bag of
gold at the end of it is known to many an English and American
child.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the nature of the original suggestion,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>there are definite reasons why, when the Serpent
was caught up to be part of combinations representing a Principle of
Evil, his character as guardian of treasures should become of great
importance. Wealth is the characteristic of the gods of the Hades, or
unseen world beneath the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>In the vast Sinhalese demonology we find the highest class of demons
(dewatawas) described as resident in golden palaces, glittering with
gems, themselves with skins of golden hue, wearing cobras as ornaments,
their king, Wessamony seated on a gem-throne and wielding a golden
sword. Pluto is from the word for wealth (<span class="trans" title=
"ploutos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&pi;&lambda;&omicron;&#8166;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>),
as also is his Latin name Dis (<i>dives</i>). For such are lords of all
beneath the sod, or the sea&rsquo;s surface. Therefore, it is important
to observe, they own all the seeds in the earth so long as they remain
seeds. So soon as they spring to flower, grain, fruitage, they belong
not to the gods of Hades but to man: an idea which originated the myth
of Persephone, and seems to survive in a school of extreme vegetarians,
who refuse to eat vegetables not ripened in the sun.</p>
<p>These considerations may enable us the better to apprehend the
earlier characters of Ahi, the Throttler, and Vritra, the Coverer. As
guardians of such hidden treasures as metals and drugs the Serpent
might be baroneted and invoked to bestow favours; but those particular
serpents which by hiding away the cloud-cows withheld the rain, or
choked the rivers with drought, all to keep under-world garners fat and
those of the upper world lean, were to be combated. Against them man
invoked the celestial deities, reminding them that their own altars
must lack offerings if they did not vanquish these thievish Binders and
Concealers.</p>
<p>The Serpent with its jewelled raiment, its self-renovating power,
and its matchless accomplishments for lurking, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>hiding, fatally striking, was gradually
associated with undulations of rivers and sea-waves on the earth, with
the Milky-way, with &lsquo;coverers&rsquo; of the sky&mdash;night and
cloud&mdash;above all, with the darting, crooked, fork-tongued
lightning. It may have been the lightning that was the Amrita churned
out of the azure sea in the myth of the
&lsquo;Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata,&rsquo; when the gods and demons
turned the mountain with a huge serpent for cord (p. 59), meaning the
descent of fire, or its discovery; but other fair and fruitful things
emerged also,&mdash;the goddess of wine, the cow of plenty, the tree of
heaven. The inhabitants of Burmah still have a custom of pulling at a
rope to produce rain. A rain party and a drought party tug against each
other, the rain party being allowed the victory, which, in the popular
notion is generally followed by rain. I have often seen snakes hung up
after being killed to bring rain, in the State of Virginia. For there
also rain means wealth. It is there believed also that, however much it
may be crushed, a snake will not die entirely until it thunders. These
are distant echoes of the Vedic sentences. &lsquo;Friend Vishnu,&rsquo;
says Indra, &lsquo;stride vastly; sky give room for the thunderbolt to
strike; let us slay Vritra and let loose the waters.&rsquo;
&lsquo;When, Thunderer, thou didst by thy might slay Vritra, who
stopped up the streams, then thy dear steeds grew.<span class="corr"
id="xd26e6236" title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>Vritra, though from the same root as Varuna (the sky), means at
first a coverer of the sky&mdash;cloud or darkness; hence eventually he
becomes the hider, the thief, who steals and conceals the bounties of
heaven&mdash;a rainless cloud, a suffocating night; and eventually
Vritra coalesces with the most fearful phantasm of the Aryan
mind&mdash;the serpent Ahi.</p>
<p>The Greek word for Adder, <span class="trans" title=
"echis"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7956;&chi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span></span>, is a modification of
Ahi. Perhaps there exists no more wonderful example <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>of
the unconscious idealism of human nature than the history of the name
of the great Throttler, as it has been traced by Professor Max
M&uuml;ller. The Serpent was also called <i>ahi</i> in Sanskrit, in
Greece <i>echis</i> or <i>echidna</i>, in Latin <i lang=
"la">anguis</i>. The root is <i>ah</i> in Sanskrit, or <i>amh</i>,
which means to press together, to choke, to throttle. It is a curious
root this <i>amh</i>, and it still lives in several modern words, In
Latin it appears as <i lang="la">ango, anxi, anctum</i>, to strangle;
in <i>angina</i>, quinsy; in <i>angor</i>, suffocation. But
<i>angor</i> meant not only quinsy or compression of the neck: it
assumed a moral import, and signifies anguish or anxiety. The two
adjectives <i>angustus</i>, narrow, and <i>anxius</i>, uneasy, both
came from the same root. In Greek the root retained its natural and
material meaning; in <i>eggys</i>, near, and <i>echis</i>, serpent,
throttler. But in Sanskrit it was chosen with great truth as the proper
name of sin. Evil no doubt presented itself under various aspects to
the human mind, and its names are many; but none so expressive as those
derived from our root <i>amh</i>, to throttle. <i>Amhas</i> in Sanskrit
means sin, but it does so only because it meant originally
throttling&mdash;the consciousness of sin being like the grasp of the
assassin on the throat of the victim. All who have seen and
contemplated the statue of Laokoon and his sons, with the serpent
coiled around them from head to foot, may realise what those ancients
felt and saw when they called sin <i>amhas</i>, or the throttler. This
<i>amhas</i> is the same as the Greek <i>agos</i>, sin. In Gothic the
same root has produced <i>agis</i>, in the sense of fear, and from the
same source we have <i>awe</i>, in <i>awful</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, fearful,
and <i>ug</i> in <i>ugly</i>. The English <i>anguish</i> is from the
French <i>angoise</i>, a corruption of the Latin
<i>angustit&aelig;</i>, a strait.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6345src"
href="#xd26e6345" name="xd26e6345src">4</a> In this wonderful history
of a word, whose biography, as Max M&uuml;ller in his Hibbert Lectures
said of <i>Deva</i>, might fill a volume, may also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>be
included our <i>ogre</i>, and also the German <i lang="de">unke</i>,
which means a &lsquo;frog&rsquo; or &lsquo;toad,&rsquo; but originally
a &lsquo;snake&rsquo;&mdash;especially the little house-snake which
plays a large part in Teutonic folklore, and was supposed to bring good
luck.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6360src" href="#xd26e6360" name=

<p>This euphemistic variant is, however, the only exception I can find
to the baleful branches into which the root <i>ah</i> has grown through
the world; one of its fearful fruits being the accompanying figure,
copied from one of the ornamental bosses of Wells Cathedral.</p>

<p>The Adder demon has been universal. Herodotus relates that from a
monster, half-woman, half-serpent, sprang the Scythians, and the fable
has often been remembered in the history of the Turks. The
&lsquo;Zoh&aacute;k&rsquo; of Firdusi is the Iranian form of Ahi. The
name is the Arabicised form of the &lsquo;Azhi Dah&aacute;ka&rsquo; of
the Avesta, the &lsquo;baneful serpent&rsquo; vanquished by
Thra&ecirc;taono (Traitana of the Vedas), and this Iranian name again
(D&aacute;saka) is Ahi. The name reappears in the Median
Astyages.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6378src" href="#xd26e6378" name=
"xd26e6378src">6</a> Zoh&aacute;k is represented as having two serpents
growing out of his shoulders, which the late Professor Wilson supposed
might have been suggested by a phrase in the <i>Kankato na</i> (ye
ansy&aacute; ye angy&aacute;h) which he translates, &lsquo;Those who
move with their shoulders, those who move with their bodies,&rsquo;
which, however, may mean &lsquo;those produced on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>shoulders, biting with them,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;might furnish those who seek for analogies between Iranian and
Indian legends with a parallel in the story of Zoh&aacute;k.&rsquo; The
legend alluded to is a favourite one in Persia, where it is used to
point a moral, as in the instruction of the learned Saib to the Prince,
his pupil. Saib related to the boy the story of King Zoh&aacute;k, to
whom a magician came, and, breathing on him, caused two serpents to
come forth from the region of his breast, and told him they would bring
him great glory and pleasure, provided he would feed these serpents
with the poorest of his subjects. This Zoh&aacute;k did; and he had
great pleasure and wealth until his subjects revolted and shut the King
up in a cavern where he became himself a prey to the two serpents. The
young Prince to whom this legend was related was filled with horror,
and begged Saib to tell him a pleasanter one. The teacher then related
that a young Sultan placed his confidence in an artful courtier who
filled his mind with false notions of greatness and happiness, and
introduced into his heart Pride and Voluptuousness. To those two
passions the young Sultan sacrificed the interests of his kingdom,
until his subjects banished him; but his Pride and Voluptuousness
remained in him, and, unable to gratify them in his exile, he died of
rage and despair. The prince-pupil said, &lsquo;I like this story
better than the other.&rsquo; &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; said Saib,
&lsquo;it is the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is curious that this old Persian fable should have survived in
the witch-lore of America, and at last supplied Nathaniel Hawthorne
with the theme of one of his beautiful allegorical
romances,&mdash;that, namely, of the man with a snake in his bosom
which ever threatened to throttle him if he did not feed it. It came to
the American fabulist through many a mythical skin, so to say. One of
the most beautiful it has worn is a story which is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>still told by mothers to their children in some
districts of Germany. It relates that a little boy and girl went into
the fields to gather strawberries. After they had gathered they met an
aged woman, who asked for some of the fruit. The little girl emptied
her basket into the old woman&rsquo;s lap; but the boy clutched his,
and said he wanted his berries for himself. When they had passed on the
old woman called them back, and presented to each a little box. The
girl opened hers, and found in it two white caterpillars which speedily
became butterflies, then grew to be angels with golden wings, and bore
her away to Paradise. The boy opened his box, and from it issued two
tiny black worms; these swiftly swelled to huge serpents, which,
twining all about the boy&rsquo;s limbs, drew him away into the dark
forest; where this Teutonic Laokoon still remains to illustrate in his
helplessness the mighty power of little faults to grow into bad habits
and bind the whole man. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href=

Germany&mdash;King-snakes&mdash;Heraldic dragon&mdash;Henry

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A Dragoon once presented himself before Frederick the
Great and offered the king a small pebble, which, he said, had been cut
from the head of a king-snake, and would no doubt preserve the throne.
Frederick probably trusted more to dragoons than dragons, but he kept
the little curiosity, little knowing, perhaps, that it would be as
prolific of legends as the cock&rsquo;s egg, to which it is popularly
traceable, in cockatrices (whose name may have given rise to the
cock-fables) or basilisks. It has now taken its place in German
folklore that Frederick owed his greatness to a familiar kept near him
in the form of a basilisk. But there are few parts of the world where
similar legends might not spring up and coil round any famous
reputation. An Indian newspaper, the <i>Lawrence Gazette</i>, having
mentioned that the ex-king of Oudh is a collector of snakes,
adds&mdash;&lsquo;Perhaps he wishes to become possessed of the precious
jewel which some serpents are said to contain, or of that species of
snake by whose means, it is said, a person can fly in the air.&rsquo;
Dr. Dennys, in whose work on Chinese Folklore this is quoted, finds the
same notion in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>China. In one story a foreigner repeatedly tries
to purchase a butcher&rsquo;s bench, but the butcher refuses to sell
it, suspecting there must be some hidden value in the article; for this
reason he puts the bench by, and when the foreigner returns a year
afterwards, learns from him that lodged in the bench was a snake, kept
alive by the blood soaking through it, which held a precious gem in its
mouth&mdash;quite worthless after the snake was dead. Cursing his
stupidity at having put the bench out of use, the butcher cut it open
and found the serpent dead, holding in its mouth something like the eye
of a dried fish.</p>
<p>Here we have two items which may only be accidental, and yet, on the
other hand, possibly possess significance. The superior knowledge about
the serpent attributed to a &lsquo;foreigner&rsquo; may indicate that
such stories in China are traditionally alien, imported with the
Buddhists; and the comparison of the dead gem to an eye may add a
little to the probabilities that this magical jewel, whether in head of
toad or serpent, is the reptile&rsquo;s eye as seen by the glamour of
human eyes. The eye of the basilisk is at once its wealth-producing,
its fascinating, and its paralysing talisman, though all these beliefs
have their various sources and their several representations in
mythology. That it was seen as a gem was due, as I think, to the
jewelled skin of most serpents, which gradually made them symbols of
riches; that it was believed able to fascinate may be attributed to the
general principles of illusion already considered; but its paralysing
power, its evil eye, connects it with a notion, found alike in Egypt
and India, that the serpent kills with its eye. Among Sanskrit words
for serpent are &lsquo;<i>drig-visha</i>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<i>drishti-visha</i>&rsquo;&mdash;literally &lsquo;having poison
in the eye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While all serpents were lords and guardians of wealth, certain of
them were crested, or had small horns, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>conveyed the idea of a crowned and imperial
snake, the <span class="trans" title="basiliskos"><span class="Greek"
lang=
"grc">&beta;&alpha;&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&#8055;&sigma;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>.
Naturalists have recognised this origin of the name by giving the same
(<i>Basiliscus mitratus</i>) to a genus of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e6430" title="Source: Inguanid&aelig;">Iguanid&aelig;</span>,
remarkable for a membranous crest not only on the occiput but also
along the back, which this lizard can raise and depress at pleasure.
But folklore, the science of the ignorant, had established the same
connection by alleging that the basilisk is hatched from the egg of a
black cock,&mdash;which was the peasant&rsquo;s explanation of the word
cockatrice. De Plancy traces one part of the belief to a disease which
causes the cock to produce a small egg-like substance; but the
resemblance between its comb and the crests of serpent and
frog<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6433src" href="#xd26e6433" name=
"xd26e6433src">1</a> was the probable link between them; while the
ancient eminence of the cock as the bird of dawn relegated the origin
of the basilisk to a very exceptional member of the family&mdash;a
black cock in its seventh year. The useful fowl would seem, however, to
have suffered even so slightly mainly through a phonetic misconception.
The word &lsquo;cockatrice&rsquo; is &lsquo;crocodile&rsquo;
transformed. We have it in the Old French &lsquo;cocatrix,&rsquo; which
again is from the Spanish &lsquo;cocotriz,&rsquo; meaning
&lsquo;crocodile,&rsquo;&mdash;<span class="trans" title=
"krokodeilos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&kappa;&rho;&omicron;&kappa;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span></span>;
which Herodotus, by the way, uses to denote a kind of lizard, and whose
sanctity has extended from the Nile to the Danube, where folklore
declares that the skeleton of the lizard presents an image of the
passion of Christ, and it must never be harmed. Thus
&lsquo;cockatrice&rsquo; has nothing to do with &lsquo;cock&rsquo; or
&lsquo;coq,&rsquo; though possibly the coincidence of the sound has
marred the ancient fame of the &lsquo;Bird of Dawn.&rsquo; Indeed black
cocks have been so generally slain on this account that they were for a
long time rare, and so the basilisks had a chance of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>becoming extinct. There were fabulous creatures
enough, however, to perpetuate the basilisk&rsquo;s imaginary powers,
some of which will be hereafter considered. We may devote the remainder
of this chapter to the consideration of a variant of dragon-mythology,
which must be cleared out of our way in apprehending the Dragon. This
is the agathodemonic or heraldic Dragon, which has inherited the
euphemistic characters of the treasure-guarding and crowned
serpent.</p>
<p>In Slavonic legend the king-serpent plays a large part, and
innumerable stories relate the glories of some peasant child that,
managing to secure a tiny gem from his crown, while the reptilian
monarch was bathing, found the jewel daily surrounded with new
treasures. This is the same serpent which, gathering up the myths of
lightning and of comets, flies through many German legends as the red
Drake, Kolbuk, Alp, or Alberflecke, dropping gold when it is red, corn
if blue, and yielding vast services and powers to those who can
magically master it. The harmless serpents of Germany were universally
invested with agathodemonic functions, though they still bear the name
that relates them to Ahi, viz., <i>unken</i>. Of these household-snakes
Grimm and Simrock give much information. It is said that in fields and
houses they approach solitary children and drink milk from the dish
with them. On their heads they wear golden crowns, which they lay down
before drinking, and sometimes forget when they retire. They watch over
children in the cradle, and point out to their favourites where
treasures are hidden. To kill them brings misfortune. If the parents
surprise the snake with the child and kill it, the child wastes away.
Once the snake crept into the mouth of a pregnant woman, and when the
child was born the snake was found closely coiled around its neck, and
could only be untwined by a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href=
"#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>milk-bath; but it never left the
child&rsquo;s side, ate and slept with it, and never did it harm. If
such serpents left a house or farm, prosperity went with them. In some
regions it is said a male and female snake appear whenever the master
or mistress of the house is about to die, and the legends of the
<i>Unken</i> sometimes relapse into the original fear out of which they
grew. Indeed, their vengeance is everywhere much dreaded, while their
gratitude, especially for milk, is as imperishable as might be expected
from their ancestor&rsquo;s quarrel with Indra about the stolen cows.
In the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> it is related that a milkmaid was
regularly approached at milking-time by a large snake to which she gave
milk. The maid having left her place, her successor found on the
milking-stool a golden crown, on which was inscribed &lsquo;In
Gratitude.&rsquo; The crown was sent to the milkmaid who had gone, but
from that time the snake was never seen again.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6460src" href="#xd26e6460" name="xd26e6460src">2</a></p>
<p>In England serpents were mastered by the vows of a saintly
Christian. The Knight Bran in the Isle of Wight is said to have picked
up the cockatrice egg, to have been pursued by the serpents, which he
escaped by vowing to build St. Lawrence Church in that
island,&mdash;the egg having afterwards brought him endless wealth and
uniform success in combat. With the manifold fables concerning the
royal dragon would seem to blend traditions of the astrological,
celestial, and lightning serpents. But these would coincide with a
development arising from the terrestrial worms and their heroic
slayers. The demonic dragon with his terrible eye might discern from
afar the advent of his predestined destroyer. It might seek to devour
him in infancy. As the comet might be deemed a portent of some powerful
prince born on earth, so it might be a compliment to a royal family, on
the birth of a prince, to report <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366"
href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>that a dragon had been seen.
Nor would it be a long step from this office of the dragon as the
herald of greatness to placing that monster on banners. From these
banners would grow sagas of dragons encountered and slain. The devices
might thus multiply. Some process of this kind would account for the
entirely good reputation of the dragon in China and Japan, where it is
the emblem of all national grandeur. It would also appear to underlie
the proud titles of the Pythian Apollo and Bellerophon, gained from the
monsters they were said to have slain. The city of Worms takes its name
from the serpent instead of its slayer.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6467src" href="#xd26e6467" name="xd26e6467src">3</a> Pendragon,
in the past&mdash;and even our dragoon of the present&mdash;are names
in which the horrors of the monster become transformed in the
hero&rsquo;s fame. The dragon, says Mr. Hardwicke, was the standard of
the West Saxons, and of the English previous to the Norman Conquest. It
formed one of the supporters of the royal arms borne by all the Tudor
monarchs, with the exception of Queen Mary, who substituted the eagle.
Several of the Plantagenet kings and princes inscribed a figure of the
dragon on their banners and shields. Peter Langtoffe says, at the
battle of Lewis, fought in 1264, &lsquo;The king schewed forth his
schild, his dragon full austere.&rsquo; Another authority says the said
king (Henry III.) ordered to be made &lsquo;a dragon in the manner of a
banner, of a certain red silk embroidered with gold; its tongue like a
flaming fire must always seem to be moving; its eyes must be made of
sapphire, or of some other stone suitable for that
purpose.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6470src" href="#xd26e6470"
name="xd26e6470src">4</a></p>
<p>It will thus be seen that an influence has been introduced into
dragon-lore which has no relation whatever to the demon itself. This
will explain those variants of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367"
href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>legend of Melusina&mdash;the
famous woman-serpent&mdash;which invest her with romance. Melusina,
whose indiscreet husband glanced at her in forbidden hours, when she
was in her serpent shape, was long the glory of the Chateau de
Lusignan, where her cries announced the approaching death of her
descendants. There is a peasant family still dwelling in Fontainebleau
Forest who claim to be descended from Melusina; and possibly some
instance of this kind may have dropped like a seed into the memory of
the author of &lsquo;Elsie Venner&rsquo; to reappear in one of the
finest novels of our generation. The corresponding sentiment is found
surrounding the dragon in the familiar British legend of the
Laidley<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6477src" href="#xd26e6477" name=
"xd26e6477src">5</a> Worm. The king of Northumberland brought home a
new Queen, who was also a sorceress, and being envious of the beauty of
her step-daughter, changed that poor princess into the worm which
devastated all Spindleton Heugh. For seven miles every green thing was
blighted by its venom, and seven cows had to yield their daily supplies
of milk. Meanwhile the king and his son mourned the disappearance of
the princess. The young prince fitted out a ship to go and slay the
dragon. The wicked Queen tries unsuccessfully to prevent the
expedition. The prince leaps from his ship into the shallow sea, and
wades to the rock around which the worm lay coiled. But as he drew near
the monster said to him:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">Oh, quit thy sword, and bend thy bow,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2635">And give me kisses three;</p>
<p class="line">If I&rsquo;m not won ere the sun goes down,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2635">Won I shall never be.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">He quitted his sword and bent his bow,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2635">He gave her kisses three;</p>
<p class="line">She crept into a hole a worm,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2635">But out stept a ladye.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the end the prince managed to have the wicked Queen transformed
into a toad, which in memory thereof, as every Northumbrian boy knows,
spits fire to this day: but it is notable that the sorceress was
<i>not</i> transformed into a dragon, as the story would probably have
run if the dragon form had not already been detached from its original
character, and by many noble associations been rendered an honourable
though fearful shape for maidens like this princess and like
Melusina.</p>
<p>In the same direction point the legends which show dragons as
sometimes victorious over their heroic assailants. Geoffrey of Monmouth
so relates of King Morvidus of Northumbria, who encountered a dragon
that came from the Irish Sea, and was last seen disappearing in the
monster&rsquo;s jaws &lsquo;like a small fish.&rsquo; A more famous
instance is that of Beowulf, whose Anglo-Saxon saga is summed up by
Professor Morley as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;Afterward the broad land came
under the sway of Beowulf. He held it well for fifty winters, until in
the dark night a dragon, which in a stone mound watched a hoard of gold
and cups, won mastery. It was a hoard heaped up in sin, its lords were
long since dead; the last earl before dying hid it in the earth-cave,
and for three hundred winters the great scather held the cave, until
some man, finding by chance a rich cup, took it to his lord. Then the
den was searched while the worm slept; again and again when the dragon
awoke there had been theft. He found not the man but wasted the whole
land with fire; nightly the fiendish air-flyer made fire grow hateful
to the sight of men. Then it was told to Beowulf&#8202;&hellip;. He
sought out the dragon&rsquo;s den and fought with him in awful strife.
One wound the poison-worm struck in the flesh of Beowulf.&rsquo;
Whereof Beowulf died.</p>
<p>Equally significant is the legend that when King Arthur <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>had
embarked at Southampton on his expedition against Rome, about midnight
he saw in a dream &lsquo;a bear flying in the air, at the noise of
which all the shores trembled; also a terrible dragon, flying from the
west, which enlightened the country with the brightness of its eyes.
When these two met they had a dreadful fight, but the dragon with its
fiery breath burned the bear which assaulted him, and threw him down
scorched to the earth.&rsquo; This vision was taken to augur
Arthur&rsquo;s victory. The father of Arthur had already in a manner
consecrated the symbol, being named Uther Pendragon (dragon&rsquo;s
head). On the death of his brother Aurelius, it was told &lsquo;there
appeared a star of wonderful magnitude and brightness, darting forth a
ray, at the end of which was a globe of fire, in form of a dragon, out
of whose mouth issued two rays, one of which seemed to stretch out
itself towards the Irish Sea, and ended in seven lesser rays.&rsquo;
Merlin interpreted this phenomenon to mean that Uther would be made
king and conquer various regions; and after his first victory Uther had
two golden dragons made, one of which he presented to Winchester
Cathedral, retaining the other to attend him in his wars.</p>
<p>In the legend of Merlin and Vortigern we find the Dragon so
completely developed into a merely warrior-like symbol that its moral
character has to be determined by its colour. As in the two armies of
serpents seen by Zoroaster, in Persian legends, which fought in the
air, the victory of the white over the black foreshowing the triumph of
Ormuzd over Ahriman, the tyranny of Vortigern is represented by a red
dragon, while Aurelius and Uther are the two heads of a white dragon.
Merlin, about to be buried alive, in pursuance of the
astrologer&rsquo;s declaration to Vortigern that so only would his
ever-falling wall stand firm, had revealed that the recurring disaster
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>caused by the struggle of these two dragons
underground. When the monsters were unearthed they fought terribly,
until the white one</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">Hent the red with all his might,</p>
<p class="line">And to the ground he him cast,</p>
<p class="line">And, with the fire of his blast,</p>
<p class="line">Altogether brent the red,</p>
<p class="line">That never of him was founden shred;</p>
<p class="line">But dust upon the ground he lay.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The white dragon vanished and was seen no more; but
the tyrant Vortigern fulfilled the fate of the red dragon, being burnt
in his castle near Salisbury. These two dragons met again, however, as
red and white roses.</p>
<p>Many developments corresponding to these might be cited. One indeed
bears a startling resemblance to our English legends. Of King Nuat
Meiamoun, whose conquest of Egypt is placed by G. Maspero about B.C.
664&ndash;654, the Ethiopian &lsquo;Stele of the Dream&rsquo;
relates:&mdash;&lsquo;His Majesty beheld a dream in the night, two
snakes, one to his right, the other to his left, (and) when His Majesty
awoke &hellip; he said: &lsquo;Explain these things to me on the
moment,&rsquo; and lo! they explained it to him, saying: &lsquo;Thou
wilt have the Southern lands, and seize the Northern, and the two
crowns will be put on thy head, (for) there is given unto thee the
earth in all its width and its breadth.&rsquo; These two snakes were
probably suggested by the <i>ur&aelig;i</i> of the Egyptian diadem.</p>
<p>Beyond the glory reflected upon a monster from his conqueror, there
would be reason why the alchemist and the wizard should encourage that
aspect of the dragon. The more perilous that Gorgon whose blood
Esculapius used, the more costly such medicament; while, that the
remedy may be advantageous, the monster must not be wholly destructive.
This is so with the now destructive <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>now preservative
forces of nature, and how they may blend in the theories, and subserve
the interests, of pretenders is well shown in a German work on Alchemy
(1625) quoted by Mr. Hardwicke. &lsquo;There is a dragon lives in the
forest, who has no want of poison; when he sees the sun or fire he
spits venom, which flies about fearfully. No living animal can be cured
of it; even the basilisk does not equal him. He who can properly kill
this serpent has overcome all his danger. His colours increase in
death; physic is produced from his poison, which he entirely consumes,
and eats his own venomous tail. This must be accomplished by him, in
order to produce the noblest balm. Such great virtue as we will point
out herein that all the learned shall rejoice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It will be readily understood that these traditions and fables would
combine to &lsquo;hedge about a king&rsquo; by ascribing to him
familiarity with a monster so formidable to common people, and even
investing him with its attributes. The dragon&rsquo;s name,
<span class="trans" title="drak&#333;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&delta;&rho;&#8049;&kappa;&#8182;&nu;</span></span>, derived from
the Sanskrit word for serpent (<i>d&#7771;ig-visha</i>), came to mean
&lsquo;the thing that sees.&rsquo; While this gave rise to many legends
of pr&aelig;ternatural powers of vision gained by tasting or bathing in
a dragon&rsquo;s blood, as in the poem of Siegfried; or from waters it
guarded, as &lsquo;Eye Well,&rsquo; in which Guy&rsquo;s dragon dipped
its tail to recover from wounds; the Sanskrit sense of eye-poisoning
was preserved in legends of occult and dangerous powers possessed by
kings,&mdash;one of the latest being the potent evil eye popularly
ascribed in Italy to the late Pius IX. But these stories are endless;
the legends adduced will show the sense of all those which, if
unexplained, might interfere with our clear insight into the dragon
itself, whose further analysis will prove it to be wholly
bad,&mdash;the concentrated terrors of nature. <span class=

<div class="argument">
<p class="first">The Eye of Evil&mdash;Turner&rsquo;s
Dragons&mdash;Cloud-phantoms&mdash;Paradise and the
Snake&mdash;Prometheus and Jove&mdash;Art and Nature&mdash;Dragon
forms: Anglo-Saxon, Italian, Egyptian, Greek, German&mdash;The modern
conventional Dragon.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The etymologies of the words Dragon and Ophis given in
the preceding chapter, ideally the same, both refer to powers of the
serpent which it does not possess in nature,&mdash;the
pr&aelig;ternatural vision and the glance that kills. The real nature
of the snake is thus overlaid; we have now to deal with the creation of
another world.</p>
<p>There are various conventionalised types of the Dragon, but through
them all one feature is constant,&mdash;the idealised serpent. Its
presence is the demonic or supernatural sign. The heroic dragon-slayer
must not be supposed to have wrestled with mere flesh and blood, in
whatever powerful form. The combat which immortalises him is waged with
all the pains and terrors of earth and heaven concentrated and combined
in one fearful form.</p>
<p>Impossible and phantasmal as was this form in nature, its mystical
meaning in the human mind was terribly real. It was this Eye of
anti-human nature which filled man with dismay, and conjured up the
typical phantom. It was this Pain, purposed and purposing, the Agony of
far-searching vision, subtlest skill, silently creeping, winged,
adapted to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>meet his every device with a cleverer device,
which gradually impressed mankind with belief in a general principle of
antagonism to human happiness.</p>
<p>It is only as a combination that any dragon form is miraculous.
Every constituent feature and factor of it is in nature, but here they
are rolled together in one pandemonic expression and terror. Yet no
such form loses its relations with nature: it is lightning and tempest,
fever-bearing malaria and fire, venom and fang, slime and jungle, all
the ferocities of the earth, air, and heavens, gathering to their fatal
artistic force, and waylaying man at every step in his advance. In
Turner&rsquo;s picture of Apollo slaying the Python there is a
marvellous suggestion of the natural conceptions from which the dragon
was evolved. The fearful folds of the monster, undulating with mound
and rock on which he lies, at points almost blend with tangle of bushes
and the jagged chaos amid which he stretches. The hard, wild, cruel
aspects of inanimate nature seem here and there rankly swelling to
horrible life, as yet but half-distinguishable from the stony-hearted
matrix; the crag begins to coil and quiver, the jungle puts forth in
claws; but above all appear the monstrous EYES, in which the forces of
pain, hardship, obstacle have at last acquired purpose and direction.
The god confronts them with eyes yet keener; his arrow, feathered with
eyebeams, has reached its mark, straight between the monster&rsquo;s
eyes; but there is no more anger in his face than might mar the calm
strength of a gardener clearing away the stone and thicket that make
the constituent parts of Python.</p>
<p>If we turn now to the neighbouring picture in the National Gallery
by the same artist, the Hesperian Gardens and their Guard, we behold
the Dragon on his high crag outlining and vitalising not only the edge
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name=
"pb374">374</a>]</span>rock but also the sky it meets. His breath
steams up into cloud. The heavens also have their terrors, which take
on eyes and coils. On the line of the horizon were hung the pictures of
the primitive art-gallery. Imagination painted them with brush dipped
now in blackness of the storm, now in fires of the lightning or the
sunset, but the forms were born of experience, of earthly struggle,
defeat, and victory.</p>
<p>As I write these words, I lay aside my pen to look across a little
lake amid the lonely hills of Wales to a sunset which is flooding the
sky with glory. Through the almost greenish sky the wind is bearing
fantastic clouds, that sometimes take the shape of chariots, in which
cloud-veiled forms are seated, and now great birds with variegated
plumage, all hastening as it were to some gathering-place of aerial
gods. Beneath a long bar of maroon-tint stretches a sea of yellow
light, on the hither side of which is set a garden of fleecy trees
touched with golden fruit. Amid them plays a fountain of changing
colours. On the left has stood, fast as a mountain range, a mass of
dark-blue cloud with uneven peaks; suddenly a pink faint glow shines
from behind that leaden mass, and next appears, sinuous with its long
indented top, the mighty folds of a fiery serpent. Nay, its head is
seen, its yawning lacertine jaws, its tinted crest. It is sleepless
Ladon on his high barrier keeping watch and ward over the Hesperian
garden.</p>
<p>Juno set him there, but he is the son of Ge,&mdash;the earth. The
tints of heaven invest and transform, and in a sense create him; but he
would never have been born mythologically had it not been that in this
world stings hover near all sweetness, danger environs beauty, and, as
Plato said, &lsquo;Good things come hard.&rsquo; The grace and lustre
of the serpent with his fatal fang preceded him, and all the perils
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375</a>]</span>that lurk beneath things fair and fascinating.
So far there is nothing essentially moral or unmoral about him. This
dragon is a shape designed by primitive meteorology and metaphysics
together. Man has asked what is so, and this is the answer: he has not
yet asked why it is so, whether it ought to be so, and whether it may
not be otherwise. The challenge has not yet been given, the era of
combat not yet arrived. The panoplied guard and ally of gods as unmoral
as himself has yet to be transformed under the touch of the religious
sentiment, and expelled from the heaven of nobler deities as a dragon
cast down, deformed, and degraded for ever.</p>
<p>As thought goes on, such allies compromise their employers; the
creator&rsquo;s work reflects the creator&rsquo;s character; and after
many timorous ages we find the dragon-guarded deities going down with
their cruel defenders. It is not without significance that in the
Sanskrit dictionary the most ancient of all words for god,
<i>Asura</i>, has for its primary meaning &lsquo;demon&rsquo; or
&lsquo;devil:&rsquo; the gods and dragons united to churn the ocean for
their own wealth, and in the end they were tarred with one brush. I
have already described in the beginning of this work the degradation of
deities, and need here barely recall to the reader&rsquo;s memory the
forces which operated to that result. The bearing of that force upon
the celestial or paradise-guarding Serpent is summed up in one quatrain
of Omar Khayy&aacute;m:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">O Thou who man of baser earth didst make,</p>
<p class="line xd26e2635">And e&rsquo;en in Paradise devised the
Snake;</p>
<p class="line xd26e2635">For all the sin wherewith the face of man</p>
<p class="line">Is blackened, man&rsquo;s forgiveness give&mdash;and
take!</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The heart of humanity anticipated its logic by many
ages, and, long before the daring genius of the Persian poet wrote this
immortal epitaph on the divine allies of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb376" href="#pb376" name=
"pb376">376</a>]</span>Serpent, heroes had given battle to the whole
fraternity. Nay, in their place had arisen a new race of gods, whose
theoretical omnipotence was gladly surrendered in the interest of their
righteousness; and there was now war in heaven; the dragon and his
allies were cast down, and man was now free to fight them as enemies of
the gods as well as himself. Woe henceforth to any gods suspected of
taking sides with the dragon in this man&rsquo;s life-and-death
struggle with the ferocities of nature, and with his own terrors
reflected from them! The legend of Prometheus was their
unconsciously-given &lsquo;notice to quit,&rsquo; though it waited many
centuries for its great interpreter. It is Goethe who alone has seen
how pale and weak grow Jove&rsquo;s fireworks before the
thought-thunderbolts of the artist, launched far beyond the limitations
that chain him in nature. Gods are even yet going down in many lands
before the sublime sentence of Prometheus:&mdash;</p>

<p>The dragon forms which have become familiar to us through
medi&aelig;val and modern iconography are of comparatively little
importance as illustrating the social or spiritual conditions out of
which they grew, and of which they became emblems. They long ago ceased
to be descriptive, and in the rude periods or places a very few
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>scratches were sometimes enough to indicate the
dragon; such mere suggestions in the end allowing large freedom to
subsequent designers in varying original types.</p>

<p>As to external form, the various shapes of the more primitive
dragons have been largely determined by the mythologic currents amid
which they have fallen, though their original basis in nature may
generally be traced. In the far North, where the legends of
swan-maidens, pigeon-maidens, and vampyres were paramount in the Middle
Ages, we find the bird-shaped dragon very common. Sometimes the
serpent-characteristics are pronounced, as in this ancient French
Swan-Dragon (<a href="#fig26">Fig. 26</a>); but, again, and especially
in regions where serpents are rare and comparatively innocuous, the
serpent tail is often conventionalised away, as in this initial V from
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380</a>]</span>C&aelig;dmon Manuscript, tenth century (<a href=
"#fig27">Fig. 27</a>), a fair example of the ornamental Anglo-Saxon
dragon. The cuttlefish seems to have suggested the animalised form of
the Hydra, which in turn helped to shape the Dragon of the Apocalypse.
Yet the Hydra in pictorial representation appears to have been
influenced by Assyrian ideas; for although the monster had nine heads,
it is often given seven (number of the Hathors, or Fates) by the
engravers, as in <a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>. The conflicts of Hercules
with the Hydra repeated that of Bel with Tiamat (&lsquo;the
Deep&rsquo;), and had no doubt its counterpart in that of Michael with
the Dragon,&mdash;the finest representation of which, perhaps, is the
great fresco by Spinello (fourteenth century) at Arezzo, a group from
which is presented in <a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>. In this case the
wings represent those always attributed in Semitic mythology to the
Destroying Angel. The Egyptian Dragon, of which the crocodile is the
basis, at an early period entered into christian symbolism, and
gradually effaced most of the pagan monsters. The crocodile and the
alligator, besides being susceptible of many horrible variations
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href="#pb381" name=
"pb381">381</a>]</span>in pictorial treatment, were particularly
acceptable to the Christian propaganda, because of the sanctity
attached to them by African tribes,&mdash;a sanctity which continues to
this day in many parts of that country, where to kill one of these
reptiles is believed to superinduce dangerous inundations. In Semitic
traditions, also, Leviathan was generally identified as a demonic
crocodile, and the feat of destroying him was calculated to impress the
imaginations of all varieties of people in the Southern countries for
which Christianity struggled so long. This form contributed some of its
characters to the lacertine dragons which were so often painted in the
Middle Ages, with what effect may be gathered from the accompanying
design by Albert Durer (<a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a>). In this
loathsome creature, which seeks to prevent deliverance of &lsquo;the
spirits in prison,&rsquo; we may remark the sly and cruel eye: the
pr&aelig;ternatural vision of such monsters was still strong in the
traditions of the sixteenth century. In looking at this lizard-guard at
the mouth of hell we may realise that it has been by some principle of
psychological selection that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href=
"#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>the reptilian kingdom gradually
gained supremacy in these portrayals of the repulsive. If we compare
with <a href="#fig29">Fig. 29</a> the well-known form of the
Chim&aelig;ra (<a href="#fig30">Fig. 30</a>), most of us will be
conscious of a sense of relief; for though the reptilian form is
present in the latter, it is but an appendage&mdash;almost an
ornament&mdash;to the lion. It is impossible to feel any loathing
towards this spirited Trisomatos, and one may recognise in it a
different animus from that which depicted the christian dragon. One was
meant to attest the boldness of the hero who dared to assail it; the
other was meant, in addition to that, to excite hatred and horror of
the monster assailed. We may, therefore, find a very distinct line
drawn between such forms as the Chim&aelig;ra and such as the Hydra, or
our conventional Dragon. The hairy inhabitants of Lycia, human or
bestial, whom Bellerophon conquered,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6805src" href="#xd26e6805" name="xd26e6805src">3</a> were not
meant to be such an abstract expression of the evil principle in nature
as the Dragon, and while they are generalised, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>elements included are also limited. But the
Dragon, with its claws, wings, scales, barbed and coiling tail, its
fiery breath, forked tongue, and frequent horns, includes the organic,
inorganic, the terrestrial and atmospheric, and is the combination of
harmful contrivances in nature.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the Dragon forms, whatever their original types and
their region, are represented in the conventional monster of the
European stage, which meets the popular conception. This Dragon is a
masterpiece of the popular imagination, and it required many
generations to give it artistic shape. Every Christmas he appears in
some London pantomime, with aspect similar to that which he has worn
for many ages. His body is partly green, with memories of the sea and
of slime, and partly brown or dark, with lingering shadow of
storm-clouds. The lightning flames still in his red eyes, and flashes
from his fire-breathing mouth. The thunderbolt of Jove, the spear of
Wodan, are in the barbed point of his tail. His huge
wings&mdash;batlike, spiked&mdash;sum up all the mythical life of
extinct Harpies and Vampyres. Spine of crocodile is on his neck, tail
of the serpent, and all the jagged ridges of rocks and sharp thorns of
jungles bristle around him, while the ice of glaciers and brassy
glitter of sunstrokes are in his scales. He is ideal of all that is
hard, obstructive, perilous, loathsome, horrible in nature: every
detail of him has been seen through and vanquished by man, here or
there, but in selection and combination they rise again as principles,
and conspire to form one great generalisation of the forms of
Pain&mdash;the sum of every creature&rsquo;s worst.</p>

<p class="first">The realm of the Unknown has now, by exploration of
our planet and by science, been pretty well pressed into annexation
with the Unknowable. In early periods, however, unexplored lands and
seas existed only in the human imagination, and men appear to have
included them within the laws of analogy as slowly as their descendants
so included the planets. The monstrous forms with which superstition
now peoples regions of space that cannot be visited could then dwell
securely in parts of the world where their existence or non-existence
could not be verified. Science had not yet shown the simplicity and
unity underlying the superficial varieties of nature; and though Rudolf
Raspe appeared many times, and related the adventures of his Baron
Munchausen in many languages, it was only a hundred years ago that he
managed to raise a laugh over them. It has taken nearly another hundred
to reveal the humour of Munchausenisms that relate to invisible and
future worlds.</p>
<p>The Dragon which now haunts the imagination of a few compulsory
voyagers beyond the grave originated in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb385" href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>speculations
concerning the unseen shores of equally mythical realms, whose burning
zones and frozen seas had not yet been detached from this planet to
make the Inferno of another. In our section on Demonology we have
considered many of these imaginary forms in detail, limiting ourselves
generally to the more realistic embodiments of special obstacles. Just
above that formation comes the stratum in which we find the separate
features of the previous demonic fauna combining to forms which
indicate the new creative power which, as we have seen, makes nature
over again in its own image.</p>
<p>Beginning thus on the physical plane, with a view of passing to the
social, political, and metaphysical arenas where man has successively
met his Dragons, we may first consider the combination of terrors and
perils, real and imaginary, which were confronted by the early
colonist. I will venture to call this the <span class="sc">Colonial
Dragon</span>.</p>
<p>This form may be represented by any of those forms against which the
Prometheus of &AElig;schylus cautions Io on her way to the realm which
should be called Ionia. &lsquo;When thou shalt have crossed the stream
that bounds the continents to the rosy realms of the morning where the
sun sets forth, &hellip; thou shalt reach beyond the roaring sea
Cisthene&rsquo;s Gorgonian plains, where dwell the Phorkides, &hellip;
and hard by are their three winged sisters, the Snake-haired Gorgons,
by mortals abhorred, on whom none of human race can look and
live&#8202;&hellip;. Be on thy guard against the Gryphons, sharp-fanged
hounds of Jove that never bark, and against the cavalry host of
one-eyed Arimaspians, dwelling on the gold-gushing fount, the stream of
Pluto. Thou wilt reach a distant land, a dark tribe, near to the fount
of the sun, where runs the river &AElig;thiops.&rsquo;<a class=

<p>One who has looked upon Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s Medusa at
Florence&mdash;one of the finest interpretations of a mythologic
subject ever painted&mdash;may comprehend what to the early explorer
and colonist were the fascinations of those rumoured regions where
nature was fair but girt round with terrors. The Gorgon&rsquo;s head
alone is given, with its fearful tangle of serpent tresses; her face,
even in its pain, possesses the beauty that may veil a fatal power;
from her mouth is exhaled a vapour which in its outline has brought
into life vampyre, newt, toad, and loathsome nondescript creatures.
Here is the malaria of undrained coasts, the vermin of noxious nature.
The source of these must be destroyed before man can found his city; it
is the fiery poisonous breath of the Colonial Dragon.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Fig. 31.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bellerophon and
Chim&aelig;ra</span> (Corinthian).</p>
</div>
<p>Most of the Dragon-myths of Great Britain appear to have been
importations of the Colonial monsters. Perhaps the most famous of these
in all Europe was the Chim&aelig;ra, which came westward upon coins,
Bellerophon having become a national hero at Corinth&mdash;almost
superseding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>the god of war himself&mdash;and his effigy
spread with many migrations. Our conventional figure of St. George is
still Bellerophon, though the Dragon has been substituted for
Chim&aelig;ra,&mdash;a change which christian tradition and national
respect for the lion rendered necessary (<a href="#fig31">Fig. 31</a>).
Corresponding to this change in outward representation, the
monster-myths of Great Britain have been gradually pressed into service
as moral and religious lessons. The Lambton Worm illustrates the duty
of attending mass and sanctity of the sabbath; the demon serpents of
Ireland and Cornwall prove the potency of holy exorcism; and this
process of moralisation has extended, in the case of the Boar, whose
head graces the Christmas table at Queen&rsquo;s College, Oxford, to an
illustration of the value of Aristotelian philosophy. It was with a
volume of Aristotle that the monster was slain, the mythologic
affinities of the legend being quaintly preserved in the item that it
was thrust down the boar&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>But these modifications are very transparent, the British legends
being mainly variants of one or two original myths which appear to have
grown out of the heraldic devices imported by ancient families. These
probably acquired realistic statement through the prowess and energy of
chieftains, and were exaggerated by their descendants, perhaps also
connected with some benefit to the community, in order to strengthen
the family tenure of its estates. For this kind of duty the Colonial
Dragon was the one usually imported by the family romancer or poet. The
multiplication of these fables is, indeed, sufficiently curious. It
looks as if there were some primitive agrarian sentiment which had to
be encountered by aid of appeals to exceptional warrant. The family
which could trace its title to an estate to an ancestor who rescued the
whole district, was careful to preserve some memorial <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>of
the feat. On account of the interests concerned in old times we should
be guarded in receiving the rationalised interpretations of such myths,
which have become traditional in some localities. The barbaric
achievements of knights did not lose in the ballads of minstrels any
marvellous splendours, but gained many; and most of these came from the
south and east. The Dragon which Guy of Warwick slew still retained
traces of Chim&aelig;ra; it had &lsquo;paws as a lion.&rsquo; Sir
William Dugdale thought that this was a romanticised version of a real
combat which Guy fought with a Danish chief, A.C. 926. Similarly the
Dragon of Wantley has been reduced to a fraudulent barrister.</p>
<p>The most characteristic of this class of legends is that of
Sockburn. Soon after the Norman conquest the Conyers family received
that manor by episcopal grant, the tradition being that it was because
Sir John Conyers, Knight, slew a huge Worm which had devoured many
people. The falchion with which this feat was achieved is still
preserved, and I believe it is still the custom, when a new bishop
visits that diocese, for the lord of Sockburn to present this sword.
The lord of the manor meets the bishop in the middle of the river Tees,
and says:&mdash;&lsquo;My Lord Bishop, I here present you with the
falchion wherewith the Champion Conyers slew the Worm, Dragon, or fiery
flying Serpent, which destroyed man, woman, and child, in memory of
which the king then reigning gave him the manor of Sockburn to hold by
this tenure,&mdash;that upon the first entrance of every bishop into
the country this falchion should be presented.&rsquo; The bishop
returns the sword and wishes the lord long enjoyment of the tenure,
which has been thus held since the year 1396. The family tradition is
that the Dragon was a Scotch intruder named Comyn, whom Conyers
compelled to kneel before the episcopal throne. The Conyers family of
Sockburn seem <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span>to have been at last overtaken by a Dragon which
was too much for them: the last knight was taken from a workhouse
barely in time not to die there.</p>
<p>In the &lsquo;Memoirs of the Somervilles&rsquo; we read that one of
that family acquired a parish by slaying a &lsquo;<span lang=

<p class="first">The familiar story of St. Patrick clearing the snakes
out of Ireland, and the Cornish version of it, in which the exorcist is
St. Petrox, presents some features which relate it to the
colonist&rsquo;s combat with his dragon, though it is more interesting
in other aspects. The Colonial Dragon includes the diseases, the wild
beasts, the savages, and all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href=
"#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>manner of obstructions which
environ a new country. But when these difficulties have been
surmounted, the young settlement has still its foes to contend
with,&mdash;war-like invaders from without, ambitious members within.
We then find the Dragon taking on the form of a public enemy, and his
alleged slayer is representative of the commune,&mdash;possibly in the
end to transmit its more real devourer. Most of the British
Dragon-myths have expanded beyond the stage in which they represent
merely the struggles of immigrants with wild nature, and include the
further stage where they represent the formation of the community. The
growth of patriotism at length is measured by its shadow. The Colonial
is transformed to the Communal Dragon. Many Dragon-myths are
adaptations of the ancient symbolism to <i>hostes communes</i>: such
are the monsters described as desolating villages and districts, until
they are encountered by antagonists animated by public spirit. Such
antagonists are distinguishable from the heroes that go forth to rescue
the maiden in distress: their chief representative in mythology is
Herakles, most of whose labours reveal the man of self-devotion
redressing public wrongs, and raising the standard of humanity as well
as civilisation.</p>
<p>The age of chivalry has its legend in the Centaurs and Cheiron. The
Hippo-centaurs are mounted savages: Cheiron is the true knight,
withstanding monsters in his own shape, saving Peleus from them, and
giving hospitality to the Argonauts. The mounted man was dragon to the
man on foot until he became the chevalier; then the demonic character
passed to the strategist who had no horse. It is curious enough to find
existing among the Mormons a murderous order calling themselves
Danites, or Destroying Angels, after the text of Gen. xlix. 17,
&lsquo;Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name=
"pb391">391</a>]</span>path, that biteth the horse&rsquo;s heel that
his rider shall fall backward.&rsquo; The Ritter, however, so far as
his Dragon was concerned, was as one winged, and every horse a Pegasus
when it bore him to decide the day between the adder and its victim. It
is remarkable that the Mormons should have carried from the East a
cruel superstition to find even among the Red Men, who are disappearing
before the western march of Saxon strength, more gentle fables.</p>
<p>Among the Mimacs, the aborigines of Nova Scotia, there is a legend
of a young hero named Keekwajoo, who, in seeking for a wife, is
befriended by a good sage named Glooscap, who warns him against a
powerful magician disguised as a beaver, and two demon sisters, who
will waylay him in the disguise of large weasels. The youth is
admonished to beat a certain drum as his canoe passes them, and he is
saved as Orpheus in passing Cerberus and Ulysses in sailing past the
Syrens. The weasels, hearing the music, aspire to wed the stars, but
find themselves in an indescribable nest at the top of a tall white
pine.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6941src" href="#xd26e6941" name=
"xd26e6941src">3</a></p>
<p>The chevalier encounters also the <span class="sc">Brutal
Dragon</span>, whose victim is Woman. From immemorial time man&rsquo;s
captive, unable to hold her own against brute force, she is at the
mercy of all who are insensible to the refined and passive powers. The
rock-bound Andromeda, the pursued Leto, or whatever fair maid it may be
that the Dragon-slayer rescues, may have begun mythologically as emblem
of the Dawn, whose swallower is the Night Cloud; but in the end she
symbolises a brighter dawn,&mdash;that of civility and magnanimity
among men.</p>
<p>It is a notable fact that far away in Japan we should find a
Dragon-myth which would appear to represent, with rare beauty, the
social evolution we have been considering. Their great mythological
Serpent, <span class="corr" id="xd26e6951" title=
"Source: Yamati-no-oroti">Yamati-no-orochi</span>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name="pb392">392</a>]</span>that
is, the serpent of eight heads and tails, stretching over eight
valleys, would pretty certainly represent a river annually overflowing
its banks. One is reminded by this monster of the accounts given by
Mencius of the difficulties with streams which the Chinese had to
surmount before they could make the Middle States habitable. But this
Colonial Dragon, in the further evolution of the country, reappears as
the <i>Brutal Dragon</i>. The admirable legend relates that, while the
rest of the world were using stone implements, there came into the
possession of Sosano-o-no-Mikoto (the Prince of Sosano) a piece of iron
which was wrought into a sword. That maiden-sword of the world was
fleshed to save a maiden from the jaws of a monster. The prince
descended from heaven to a bank of the river Hino Kawa, and the country
around seemed uninhabited; but presently he saw a chopped stick
floating down the stream, and concluded that there must be beings
dwelling farther up; so he travelled until he came to a spot where he
beheld an aged man and his wife (Asinaduti and Tenaduti), with their
beautiful daughter, Him&eacute; of Inada. The three were weeping
bitterly, and the prince was informed that Him&eacute; was the last of
their daughters, seven of whom had been devoured by a terrible serpent.
This serpent had eight heads, and the condition on which it had ceased
to desolate the district was that one of these eight maidens should be
brought annually to this spot to satisfy his voracity. The last had now
been brought to complete the dreadful compact. The Japanese are careful
to distinguish this serpent from a dragon, with them an agathodemon. It
had no feet, and its heads branched by as many necks from a single
body, this body being so large that it stretched over eight valleys. It
was covered with trees and moss, and its belly was red as blood. The
prince doubted if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393"
name="pb393">393</a>]</span>even with his sword he could encounter such
a monster, so he resorted to stratagem; he obtained eight vast bowls,
filled them with eight different kinds of wine, and, having built a
fence with the same number of openings, set a bowl in each. The result
may be imagined: the eight heads in passing over the bowls paused,
drank deep, and were soon in a state of beastly intoxication. In this
condition the heads were severed from their neck, and the maiden saved
to wed the first Mikado Prince. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Theology has pronounced Incarnation a mystery, but
nothing is simpler. The demigod is man&rsquo;s appeal from the gods. It
may also be, as Emerson says, that &lsquo;when the half-gods go the
gods arrive,&rsquo; but it is equally true that their coming signals
the departure of deities which man had long invoked in vain. The great
Heraklean myth presents us the ideal of godlike force united to human
sympathy. Ra (the Sun) passing the twelve gates (Hours) of Hades
(Night)<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6973src" href="#xd26e6973" name=
"xd26e6973src">1</a> is humanised in Herakles and his Twelve Labours.
He is Son of Zeus by a human mother&mdash;Alcmene&mdash;and his labours
for human welfare, as well as his miraculous conception, influenced
Christianity. The divine Man assailing the monsters of divine creation
represents human recognition of the fact that moral order in nature is
co-extensive with the control of mankind. One expression of this
perception is the Alcestis of Euripides, whose significance in relation
to death we have considered.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6976src" href=
"#xd26e6976" name="xd26e6976src">2</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Alcestis,&rsquo; as I have written in another work, &lsquo;is
one of the few ancient Greek melodramas. The majority of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>dramas left us by the poets of Greece turn upon
religious themes, and usually they are tragedies. It is evident that to
them the popular religion around them was itself a tragedy. Their
heroes and heroines&mdash;such as Prometheus and Macaria&mdash;were
generally victims of the jealousy or caprice of the gods; and though
the poets display in their dramas the irresistible power of the gods,
they do so without reverence for that power, and generally show the
human victims to be more honourable than the gods. But the
&lsquo;Alcestis&rsquo; of Euripides is not a tragedy; it ends happily,
and in the rescue of one of those victims of the gods. It stands as
about the first notice served on the gods that the human heart had got
tired of their high-handed proceedings, and they might prepare to quit
the thrones of a universe unless they could exhibit more
humanity&#8202;&hellip;. Knowing that neither he nor any other deity
can legally resist the decree of another deity, Apollo is reduced to
hope for help from man. Human justice may save when divine justice
sacrifices. He prophesies to Death that although he may seize Alcestis,
a man will come who will conquer him, and deliver that woman from the
infernal realm&#8202;&hellip;. Then Hercules comes on the scene. He has
been slaying lion and dragon, and he now resolves to conquer Death and
deliver Alcestis. This he does.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6983src" href="#xd26e6983" name="xd26e6983src">3</a></p>
<p>In this pre-christian yet christian Passion Play, the part played by
the heart of woman is equally heroic with that which represents the
honour of man. So in the religion which followed there was an effort to
set beside the incarnate vanquisher of infernal powers the pierced
heart of Mary. But among all the legends of this character it were
difficult to find one more impressive than that which Dr. Leitner found
in Dardistan, and one which, despite its <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb396" href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>length, will repay a
careful perusal. This legend of the origin of the Ghilghit tribe and
government was told by a native.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once upon a time there lived a race at Ghilghit whose origin
is uncertain. Whether they sprung from the soil or had immigrated from
a distant region is doubtful; so much is believed that they were
Gayup&iacute;, <i>i.e.</i>, spontaneous, aborigines, unknown. Over them
ruled a monarch who was a descendant of the evil spirits, the Yatsh,
who terrorised over the world. His name was Shiribadatt, and he resided
at a castle in front of which was a course for the performance of the
manly game of Polo. His tastes were capricious, and in every one of his
actions his fiendish origin could be discerned. The natives bore his
rule with resignation, for what could they effect against a monarch at
whose command even magic aids were placed? However, the country was
rendered fertile, and round the capital bloomed attractive. The
heavens, or rather the virtuous Peris, at last grew tired of his
tyranny, for he had crowned his iniquities by indulging in a propensity
for cannibalism. This taste had been developed by an accident. One day
his cook brought him some mutton broth the like of which he had never
tasted. After much inquiry as to the nature of the food on which the
sheep had been brought up, it was eventually traced to an old woman,
its first owner. She stated that her child and the sheep were born on
the same day, and losing the former, she had consoled herself by
suckling the latter. This was a revelation to the tyrant. He had
discovered the secret of the palatability of the broth, and was
determined to have a never-ending supply of it. So he ordered that his
kitchen should be regularly provided with children of a tender age,
whose flesh, when converted into broth, would remind him of the
exquisite dish he had once so much relished. This cruel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span>order was carried out. The people of the country
were dismayed at such a state of things, and sought slightly to improve
it by sacrificing, in the first place, all orphans and children of
neighbouring tribes. The tyrant, however, was insatiable, and soon was
his cruelty felt by many families at Ghilghit, who were compelled to
give up their children to slaughter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Relief came at last. At the top of the mountain Ko, which it
takes a day to ascend, and which overlooks the village of Doyur, below
Ghilghit, on the other side of the river, appeared three figures. They
looked like men, but much more strong and handsome. In their arms they
carried bows and arrows, and turning their eyes in the direction of
Doyur, they perceived innumerable flocks of sheep and cattle grazing on
a prairie between that village and the foot of the mountain. The three
strangers were brothers, and none of them had been born at the same
time. It was their intention to make Azru Shemsher, the youngest, Rajah
of Ghilghit, and, in order to achieve their purpose, they hit upon the
following plan. On the already noticed prairie, which is called
Diding&eacute;, a sportive calf was gambolling towards and away from
its mother. It was the pride of its owner, and its brilliant red colour
could be seen from a distance. &lsquo;Let us see who is the best
marksman,&rsquo; exclaimed the eldest, and, saying this, he shot an
arrow in the direction of the calf, but missed his aim. The second
brother also tried to hit it, but also failed. At last, Azru Shemsher,
who took a deep interest in the sport, shot his arrow, which pierced
the poor animal from side to side and killed it. The brothers, whilst
descending, congratulated Azru on his sportsmanship, and on arriving at
the spot where the calf was lying, proceeded to cut its throat and to
take out from its body <i>the titbits, namely, the kidneys and the
liver</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;They then roasted these delicacies, and invited Azru to
partake of them first. He respectfully declined, on the ground of his
youth, but they urged him to do so, &lsquo;in order,&rsquo; they said,
&lsquo;to reward you for such an excellent shot.&rsquo; Scarcely had
the meat touched the lips of Azru than the brothers got up, and,
vanishing into the air, called out, &lsquo;Brother! you have touched
impure food, which Peris never should eat, and we have made use of your
ignorance of this law, because we want to make you a human
being<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7005src" href="#xd26e7005" name=
"xd26e7005src">4</a> who shall rule over Ghilghit; remain, therefore,
at Doyur.&rsquo; Azru, in deep grief at the separation, cried,
&lsquo;Why remain at Doyur, unless it be to grind corn?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the brothers, &lsquo;go to Ghilghit.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;go to Ghilghit, unless it be
to work in the gardens?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; was the last and
consoling rejoinder; &lsquo;you will assuredly become the king of this
country, and deliver it from its merciless oppressor!&rsquo; No more
was heard of the departing fairies, and Azru remained by himself,
endeavouring to gather consolation from the great mission which had
been bestowed on him. A villager met him, and, struck by his
appearance, offered him shelter in his house. Next morning he went on
the roof of his host&rsquo;s house, and calling out to him to come up,
pointed to the Ko mountain, on which, he said, he plainly discerned a
wild goat. The incredulous villager began to fear he had harboured a
maniac, if no worse character; but Azru shot off his arrow, and,
accompanied by the villager (who had assembled some friends for
protection, as he was afraid his young guest might be an associate of
robbers, and lead him into a trap), went in the direction of the
mountain. There, to be sure, at the very spot that was pointed out,
though many miles distant, was lying the wild goat, with Azru&rsquo;s
arrow transfixing its body. The astonished peasants at once hailed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>him as their leader, but he exacted an oath of
secrecy from them, for he had come to deliver them from their tyrant,
and would keep his incognito till such time as his plans for the
destruction of the monster would be matured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He then took leave of the hospitable people of Doyur, and
went to Ghilghit. On reaching this place, which is scarcely four miles
distant from Doyur, he amused himself by prowling about in the gardens
adjoining the royal residence. There he met one of the female
companions of Shiribadatt&rsquo;s daughter fetching water for the
princess. This lady was remarkably handsome, and of a sweet
disposition. The companion rushed back, and told the young lady to look
from over the ramparts of the castle at a wonderfully handsome young
man whom she had just met. The princess placed herself in a place from
which she could observe any one approaching the fort. Her maid then
returned, and induced Azru to come with her in the Polo ground, in
front of the castle; the princess was smitten with his beauty, and at
once fell in love with him. She then sent word to the young prince to
come and see her. When he was admitted into her presence he for a long
time denied being anything more than a common labourer. At last he
confessed to being a fairy&rsquo;s child, and the overjoyed princess
offered him her heart and hand. It may be mentioned here that the
tyrant Shiribadatt had a wonderful horse, which could cross a mile at
every jump, and which its rider had accustomed to jump both into and
out of the fort, over its walls. So regular were the leaps which this
famous animal could take that he invariably alighted at the distance of
a mile from the fort, and at the same place. On that very day on which
the princess had admitted young Azru into the fort King Shiribadatt was
out hunting, of which he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href=
"#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>desperately fond, and to which he
used sometimes to devote a week or two at a time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must now return to Azru, whom we left conversing with the
princess. Azru remained silent when the lady confessed her love. Urged
to declare his sentiments, he said that he would not marry her unless
she bound herself to him by the most stringent oath; this she did, and
they became in the sight of God as if they were wedded man and wife. He
then announced that he had come to destroy her father, and asked her to
kill him herself. This she refused; but as she had sworn to aid him in
every way she could, he finally induced her to promise that she would
ask her father <i>where his soul was</i>. &lsquo;Refuse food,&rsquo;
said Azru, &lsquo;for three or four days, and your father, who is
devotedly fond of you, will ask for the reason of your strange conduct;
then say, &lsquo;Father, you are often staying away from me for several
days at a time, and I am getting distressed lest something should
happen to you; do reassure me by letting me know where your soul is,
and let me feel certain that your life is safe.&rsquo; This the
princess promised to do, and when her father returned refused food for
several days. The anxious Shiribadatt made inquiries, to which she
replied by making the already named request. The tyrant was for a few
moments thrown into mute astonishment, and finally refused compliance
with her preposterous demand. The love-smitten lady went on starving
herself, till at last her father, fearful for his daughter&rsquo;s
life, told her not to fret herself about him as <i>his soul was of
snow, in the snows</i>, and that he could only perish by fire. The
princess communicated this information to her lover. Azru went back to
Doyur and the villages around, and assembled his faithful peasants.
Them he asked to take twigs of the fir-tree, bind them together, and
light them; then to proceed in a body with torches <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span>to
the castle in a circle, keep close together, and surround it on every
side. He then went and dug out a very deep hole, as deep as a well, in
the place where Shiribadatt&rsquo;s horse used to alight, and covered
it with green boughs. The next day he received information that the
torches were ready. He at once ordered the villagers gradually to draw
near the fort in the manner which he had already indicated.</p>
<p>King Shiribadatt was then sitting in his castle; near him his
treacherous daughter, who was so soon to lose her parent. All at once
he exclaimed, &lsquo;I feel very close; go out, dearest, and see what
has happened.&rsquo; The girl went out, and saw torches approaching
from a distance; but fancying it to be something connected with the
plans of her husband, she went back and said it was nothing. The
torches came nearer and nearer, and the tyrant became exceedingly
restless. &lsquo;Air, air,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I feel very ill; do
see, daughter, what is the matter.&rsquo; The dutiful lady went, and
returned with the same answer as before. At last the torch-bearers had
fairly surrounded the fort, and Shiribadatt, with a presentiment of
impending danger, rushed out of the room, saying, &lsquo;that he felt
he was dying.&rsquo; He then ran to the stables and mounted his
favourite charger, and with one blow of the whip made him jump over the
wall of the castle. Faithful to its habit the noble animal alighted at
the same place, but, alas! only to find itself engulfed in a
treacherous pit. Before the king had time to extricate himself the
villagers had run up with their torches. &lsquo;Throw them upon
him,&rsquo; cried Azru. With one accord all the blazing wood was thrown
upon Shiribadatt, who miserably perished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Azru was then most enthusiastically proclaimed king, celebrated his
nuptials with the fair traitor, and, as sole tribute, exacted the
offering of one sheep annually, instead of the human child, from every
one of the natives. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402"
name="pb402">402</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Azru had safely ascended the throne he ordered the
tyrant&rsquo;s place to be levelled to the ground. The willing
peasants, manufacturing spades of iron, flocked to accomplish a
grateful task, and sang whilst demolishing his castle:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My nature is of a hard metal,&rsquo; said Shiri and Badatt.
&lsquo;Why hard? I, Koto, the son of the peasant Dem Singh, am alone
hardy; with this iron spade I raze to the ground thy kingly house.
Behold now, although thou art of race accursed, of Shatsho Malika, I,
Dem Singh&rsquo;s son, am of a hard metal; for with this iron spade I
level thy very palace; look out! look out!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7034src" href="#xd26e7034" name="xd26e7034src">5</a></p>
<p>An account of the Feast of Torches, instituted as a memorial of this
tradition, has already been given in another connection.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7039src" href="#xd26e7039" name="xd26e7039src">6</a>
The legend, the festival, and the song just quoted constitute a noble
human epic. That startling defiance of the icy-hearted god by the
human-hearted peasant, that brave cry of the long cowering wretch who
at last holds in his spade an iron weapon to wield against the hardness
of nature, are the sublime p&aelig;an of the Dragon-slayer. Look out,
ye snow-gods! Man&rsquo;s heart is there, and woman&rsquo;s heart;
their courage, plus the spade, can level your palaces; their love will
melt you, their arts and sciences kill you: so fatal may be
torches!</p>
<p>All great religions were born in this grand atheism. As the worship
of Herakles meant the downfall of Zeus, the worship of Christ meant the
overthrow of both Jove and Jehovah. Every race adores the epoch when
their fathers grew ashamed of their gods and identified them as
dragons&mdash;the supreme cruelties of nature&mdash;welcoming the man
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>who first rose from his knees and defied them.
But in the end the Priests of the Dragon manage to secure a compromise,
and by labelling him with the name of his slayer, manage to resuscitate
and re-enthrone him. For, as we shall presently see, the Dragon never
really dies.</p>
<p>Christianity did not fail to avail itself of the
Dragon-slayer&rsquo;s prestige, which had preceded it in Europe and in
Africa. It could not afford to offer for popular reverence saints less
heroic than pagan warriors and demigods. The old Dragon-myths,
especially those which made the fame of Herakles, were appropriated to
invest saintly forms. St. Michael, St. Andrew, St. Margaret, and many
another, were pictured subduing or treading on Dragons. Christ was
shown crushing the serpent Sin, spearing the dragon Death, or even
issuing from its impotent jaws, like Jason from the Dragon.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7048src" href="#xd26e7048" name="xd26e7048src">7</a>
But in this competition for the laurels of dead Dragon-slayers, and
fierce hostility to dragons already slain, the real Dragon was left to
revive and flourish in security, and in the end even inherited the
mantle and the palm of his own former conqueror.</p>
<p>The miscarriage of canonisation in the case of St. George is a small
and merely curious thing in itself; but it is almost mystical in its
coincidence with the great miscarriage which brought the cross of
Christ to authorise the crucifixions of the men most like him for a
thousand years.</p>
<p>Mr. John Ruskin has sharply challenged Ralph Waldo Emerson&rsquo;s
penetrating touch on the effigy that decorates the escutcheons of
England and Russia. &lsquo;George of Cappadocia,&rsquo; says Emerson,
&lsquo;born at Epiphania in Cilicia, was a low parasite, who got a
lucrative contract to supply the army with bacon. A rogue and an
informer, he got rich and was forced to run from justice. He saved his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>money, embraced Arianism, collected a library,
and got promoted by a faction to the episcopal throne of Alexandria.
When Julian came, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 361, George was dragged
to prison. The prison was burst open by the mob, and George was lynched
as he deserved. And this precious knave became in good time Saint
George of England, patron of chivalry, emblem of victory and civility,
and the pride of the best blood of the modern world.&rsquo; Whereon
Emerson further remarks that &lsquo;nature trips us up when we
strut.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is certainly rather hard for the founder of the St. George
Association to be told that his patron was no Dragon-slayer at all, but
the Dragon&rsquo;s ally. Mr. Ruskin may be right in contending that
whatever may have been the facts, they who made George patron saint of
England still meant their homage for a hero, or at any rate not for a
rogue; but he is unsatisfactory in his argument that our St. George was
another who died for his faith seventy years before the
bacon-contractor. Even if the Ruskin St. George, said to have suffered
under Diocletian, could be shown historical, his was a very commonplace
martyrdom compared with that of a bishop torn in pieces by a
&lsquo;pagan&rsquo; mob. The distant christian nations would never have
listened to the pagan version of the story even had it reached them. A
bishop so martyred would have been the very man to give their armies a
watchword. The martyr was portrayed as a Dragon-slayer only as a title
might be added to the name of one knighted, or the badge of an order
set upon his breast; the heraldic device grew into a variant of the
common legend which suggests the origin of the mythical George.
&lsquo;The magician Athanasius, successively an opponent of
Christianity, a convert, and a martyr, is his chief antagonist; and the
city of Alexandria appears as the Empress Alexandria, the wife of
Diocletian, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>and herself a convert and a martyr.&rsquo; This
sentence from Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;Dictionary of Greek and Roman
Biography&rsquo; tells more than Professor Ruskin&rsquo;s
seventeenth-century authority. The Dragon is the same Athanasius whose
creed sends forth its anathemas in churches dedicated to the Arian
canonised for having slain him!</p>
<p>Though it be granted that they who made George of Cappadocia the
ideal hero of England really intended their homage for a martyr and
hero, it must equally be acknowledged that his halo was clearly drawn
from Dragon-fire. He was a man who had taken to the sword, and by it
perished; so much was known and announced in his canonisation. He was
honoured as &lsquo;the Victor&rsquo; among the Greeks, therefore to-day
patron of Russia; as protector of Crusaders, therefore now patron of
England; thus is he saint of a war waged by the strong against the
weak, in interest of a church and priesthood against human freedom;
therefore George was taking the side of the Dragon against Christ,
restoring the priestly power he had assailed, and delivering up his
brave brothers in all history to be nailed to Christianity as a
cross.</p>
<p>Let George remain! Whether naming fashionable temples or engraved on
gold coins, the fictitious Dragon-slayer will remain the right saint in
the right place so long as the real Dragon-slayer is made to name every
power he hated, and to consecrate every lie in whose mouth he darted
his spear. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Asura has already been mentioned as the most ancient
Aryan name for deity. The meaning of it is, the Breather. It has also
been remarked that in the course of time the word came to signify both
the good and the evil spirit. What this evil breath meant in nature is
told in Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s picture of the expiring Medusa,
referred to on p. 386, from whose breath noxious creatures are
produced. It may have been that the artist meant only to interpret the
Gorgon as a personification of the malarious vapours of nature and
their organic kindred; if so, he painted better than he knew, and has
suggested that fatal vitality of the evil power which raised it to its
throne as a principle coeternal with good.</p>
<p>The phenomena of recurrence in things evil made for man the mystery
of iniquity. The darkness may be dispersed, but it returns; the storm
may clear away, but it gathers again; inundations, sickly seasons,
dog-days, Cain-winds, they go and return; the cancer is cut out and
grows again; the tyrant may be slain, tyranny survives. The serpent
slipping from one skin to another coils steadily into the symbol of
endlessness. In another expression it <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb407" href="#pb407" name="pb407">407</a>]</span>is the poisonous
breath of the Dragon. It is this breath that cannot be killed; the
special incarnations of it, any temporary brood of it, may be
destroyed, but the principle in nature which produces them cannot be
exterminated.</p>
<p>Dragon fables have this undertone to their brave strain. In the Rig
Veda (v. 32) it is said that when Indra slew Ahi, &lsquo;another more
powerful was generated.&rsquo; Isaiah (xiv. 29) cries, &lsquo;Rejoice
not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is
broken: for out of the serpent&rsquo;s root shall come forth a
cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.&rsquo;
Herakles struggles with the giant robber, Ant&aelig;us, only to find
the demon&rsquo;s strength restored by contact with the earth. He kills
one head of the Hydra only to see two grow in its place; and even when
he has managed to burn away these, the central head is found to be
immortal, and he can only hide it under a rock. That one is the
self-multiplying principle of evil. The vast brood of Echidna in
mythology expresses the brood of evil in nature. Echidna, daughter of
Ge and Tartarus, Earth and Hell&mdash;phonetic reappearance of
Ahi&mdash;is half-serpent, half-woman, with black eyes, fearful and
bloodthirsty. She becomes the mother of fire-breathing Typhon, buried
beneath the earth by Jove&rsquo;s lightning when he aspired to scale
Olympus; of the Dragon that guarded the Hesperian garden; of the Sphinx
which puzzled and devoured; of three-headed Cerberus; of the eagle that
preyed on rock-bound Prometheus; of the Nem&aelig;an lion which
Herakles slew; of Chim&aelig;ra; and of Scylla the monster whom Homer
describes sitting between two large rocks waylaying mariners on the way
from Italy to Sicily,&mdash;possessing twelve feet, six long necks and
mouths, each with three rows of rushing teeth.</p>
<p>The Dragon that Cadmus slew also had terrible teeth; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>and
it will be remembered that when these teeth were sown they sprang up as
armed men. Like them, the ancient Dragon-myths were also sown,
broadcast, in the mental and moral fields, cleared and ploughed by a
new theology, and they sprang up as dogmas more hard and cruel than the
ferocious forces of nature which gave birth to their ancestral
monsters.</p>
<p>What the superstitious method of interpreting nature, forced as it
is to personify its painful as well as its pleasant phenomena,
inevitably results in, finds illustration in the two great lines of
tradition&mdash;the Aryan and the Semitic&mdash;which have converged to
form the christian mythology.</p>
<p>The Hebrew personification, Jehovah, originating in a rude period,
became invested with many savage and immoral traditions; but when his
worshippers had reached a higher moral culture, national sentiment had
become too deeply involved with the sovereign majesty of their deity
for his alleged actions to be criticised, or his absolute supremacy and
omnipotence to be questioned, even to save his moral character. Thus,
the Rabbins appear to have been at their wits&rsquo; end to account for
the existence of the two great monsters which had got into their sacred
records&mdash;from an early mythology&mdash;Behemoth and Leviathan.
Unwilling to admit that Jehovah had created foes to his own kingdom, or
that creatures which had become foes to it were beyond his power to
control, they worked out a theory that Behemoth and Leviathan were made
and preserved by special order of Jehovah to execute his decrees at the
Messianic Day of Judgment. They probably corresponded at an earlier
period with the gryphon, or grabber, and the serpent which bit,
guardians at the gate of paradise; but the need of such guards, biters,
and spies by the all-powerful all-seeing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb409" href="#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>Shaddai having been
recognised, the monsters had to be rationalised into accord with his
character as a retributive ruler. Hence Behemoth and Leviathan are
represented as being fattened with the wicked, who die in order to be
the food of the righteous during the unsettled times that follow the
revelation of the Messiah! Behemoth is Jehovah&rsquo;s &lsquo;cattle on
a thousand hills&rsquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps%201:10&amp;version=NRSV">Ps.
i. 10</a>). In Pireque de Rabbi Eliezur he is described as feeding
daily upon a thousand mountains on which the grass grows again every
night; and the Jordan supplies him with drink, as it is said in Job
(<a class="biblink xd26e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

23</a>), &lsquo;he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his
mouth.&rsquo; In the Talmud these monsters are divided into two pairs,
but are said to have been made barren lest their progeny should destroy
the earth. They are kept in the wilderness of Dendain, the mythical
abode of the descendants of Cain, east of Eden, for the unique purpose
mentioned.</p>
<p>But now we may remark the steady progress of these monsters to the
bounds of their mythological habitat. There came a time when Behemoth
and Leviathan were hardly more presentable than other personified
horrors. They too must &lsquo;take the veil,&rsquo;&mdash;a period in
the history of mythical, corresponding to extinction in that of actual,
monsters. The following passage in the Book of Enoch is believed by
Professor Drummond to be a later insertion, probably from the Book of
Noah, and as early as the middle of the first century:&mdash;&lsquo;In
that day two monsters shall be divided; a female monster named
Leviathan, to dwell in the abyss of the sea, above the sources of the
waters; but the male is called Behemoth, which occupies with its breast
a desolate wilderness named Dendain, on the east of the garden where
the elect and righteous dwell, where my grandfather (Enoch) was taken
up, being the seventh from Adam, the first man whom the Lord of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>the spirits created. And I asked that other
angel to show me the might of these monsters, how they were separated
in one day, and one was set in the depth of the sea, the other on the
firm land of the wilderness. And he spoke to me, &lsquo;Thou son of
man, thou desirest in this to know what has been concealed.&rsquo; And
the other angel who went with me, and showed me what is in concealment,
spake, &hellip; &lsquo;These two monsters are prepared conformably to
the greatness of God to be fed, in order that the penal judgment of God
may not be in vain.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7107src" href=
"#xd26e7107" name="xd26e7107src">1</a></p>
<p>We may thus see that there were antecedents to the sentiment of
Aquinas,&mdash;&lsquo;<span lang="la">Beati in regno c&oelig;lesti
videbunt p&oelig;nas damnatorum, ut beatitudo illis magis
complaceat.</span>&rsquo; Or, perhaps, one might say rather to the
logic of Aquinas; for though he saw that it would be necessary for
souls in bliss to be happy at vision of the damned or else deficient in
bliss, it is said he could hardly be happy from thinking of the
irreversible doom of Satan himself. It would appear that only the
followers of the Genevan who anticipated his god&rsquo;s hell for
Servetus managed to adapt their hearts to such logic, and glory in the
endless tortures of their fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>An eloquent minister in New York, Octavius B. Frothingham, being
requested to write out his views on the &lsquo;question&rsquo; of
everlasting damnation, began with the remark that he felt somewhat as a
sportsman suddenly called upon to hunt the Iguanodon. Really it is
Behemoth and Leviathan he was called to deal with. Leviathan
transmitted from Jonah to the Middle Ages the idea of &lsquo;the belly
of Hell,&rsquo; and Behemoth&rsquo;s jaws expanded in the &lsquo;mouth
of Hell&rsquo; of the Miracle-plays; and their utility, as described in
the Book of Enoch, perhaps originated the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb411" href="#pb411" name="pb411">411</a>]</span>doctrine of souls
tasting heavenly joys from the agonies of others. The dogma of Hell has
followed the course of its prototype with precision. It has arrived at
just that period when, as in the case of Enoch&rsquo;s inquiring, the
investigator finds it has taken the veil. Theologians shake their
heads, call it a terrible question, write about free-will and sin, but
only a few, of the fatuous sort, confess belief in the old-fashioned
Hell where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p>Let us now take under consideration the outcome of the Aryan Dragon,
which has travelled far to meet Behemoth in the west. And it is
probable that we could not, with much seeking, find an example so
pregnant with instruction for our present inquiry as our little Durham
folk-tale of the Lambton Worm.</p>
<p>This Worm is said to have been slain by Sir Lambton, crusader, and
ancestor of the Earls of Durham. This young Lambton was a wild fellow;
he was fond of fishing in the river Wear, which runs near Durham
Castle, and he had an especial taste for fishing there on Sunday
mornings. He was profane, and on Sundays, when the people were all
going to mass, they were often shocked by hearing the loud oaths which
Lambton uttered whenever he had no rise. One Sunday morning something
got hold of his hook, pulled strong, and he made sure of a good trout;
what was his disappointment when instead thereof he found at the end of
his line a tiny black worm. He tore it off with fierce imprecations and
threw it in a well near by. However, soon after this the young man
joined the crusaders and went off to the Holy Land, where he
distinguished himself by slaying many Saracens.</p>
<p>But while he was off there things were going on badly around Durham
Castle. Some peasant passing that well into which the youth had cast
the tiny black worm looked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href=
"#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span>into it, and beheld a creature
that made him shudder,&mdash;a diabolical big snake with nine ferocious
eyes. A little time only had elapsed before this creature had grown too
large for the well to hold it, and it came out and crawled on, making a
path of desolation, breakfasting on a village, until it came to a small
hill. Around that hill it coiled with nine coils, each weighty enough
to make a separate terrace. One may still see this hill with its nine
terraces, and be assured of the circumstances by peasants residing
near. Having taken up its headquarters on this hill, the nine-eyed
monster was in the habit of sallying forth every day and satisfying his
hunger by devouring the plumpest family he could find, until at length
the people consulted an oracle&mdash;some say a witch, others again a
priest&mdash;and were told that the monster would be satisfied if it
were given each day the milk of nine cows. So nine cows were got
together, and a plucky dairymaid was found to milk the cows and carry
it to the dragon. If a single gill of the milk was missing the monster
took a dire revenge upon the nearest village. This was the unpleasant
situation which young Lambton found when he returned home from the
crusades. He was now an altered man. He was no longer given to fishing
and profanity. He felt keenly that by raising the demon out of the
river Wear he had brought woe upon his neighbours, and he resolved to
engage the Worm in single combat. But he learned that it had already
been fought by several knights, and had slain them, while no wounds
received by itself availed anything, since, if it were cut in twain,
the pieces grew together again. The knight then consulted the oracle,
witch or priest, and was told that he could prevail in the combat on
certain conditions. He must provide himself with special armour, all
over which must be large razor-blades. He must manage to entice the
worm into the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>middle of the river Wear, in whose waters the
combat must take place. And, finally, he must vow to slay as a
sacrifice the first living thing he should meet after his victory.
These conditions having been fulfilled, the knight entered the stream.
The dragon, not having received his milk as usual that morning, crawled
from his hill seeking whom he might devour, and seeing the knight in
the river, went at him. Quickly he coiled around the armour, but its
big razors cut him into many sections; and these sections could not
piece themselves together again because the current of the river washed
them swiftly away.</p>
<p>Now, observe how this dragon was pieced together mythologically. He
is a storm cloud. He begins smaller than a man&rsquo;s hand and swells
to huge dimensions; that characteristic of the howling storm was
represented in the howling wolf Fenris of Norse Mythology, who was a
little pet, a sort of lapdog for the gods at first, but when full grown
broke the chains that tied him to mountains, and was only fettered at
last by the thread finer than cobweb, which was really the sunbeam
conquering winter. Then, when this worm was cut in two, the parts came
together again. This feature of recurrence is especially characteristic
of Hydras. In the Egyptian &lsquo;Tale of Setnau,&rsquo; Ptah-nefer-ka
saw the river-snake twice resume its form after he had killed it with
his sword,&mdash;he succeeded the third time by placing sand between
the two parts; and what returning floods taught the ancient scribe
remained to characterise the dragon encountered by Guy of Warwick,
which recovered from every wound by dipping its tail in the well it had
guarded. The Lernean Hydra had nine heads, the Lambton Worm nine eyes
and nine folds, and drank nine cows&rsquo; milk. His fondness for the
milk of cows connects him straightly with the dragon Vritra, whom Indra
slew because he stole Indra&rsquo;s cows (that is, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>the
good clouds, whose milk is gentle rain, and do no harm), and shut them
up in a cavern to enjoy their milk himself. That is the oldest Dragon
fable on record, and it is said in the Rig-Veda that beneath
Indra&rsquo;s thunderbolt the monster broke up into pieces, and was
washed away in a current of water. Finally, in being destroyed at last
by razor blades, the dragon is connected with that slain by Ragnar, in
whose armour the sun-darts of Apollo had turned to icicles. In the
&lsquo;Death-Song of Ragnar Lodbrach,&rsquo; preserved by Olaus
Wormius, it is said that King Ella of Northumberland having captured
that terror of the North (8th cent.), ordered him to be thrown into a
pit of serpents. His surname, Lodbrach, or Hair Breeches, had been
given because of his method of slaying a Worm which devastated
Gothland, whose king had promised his daughter to the man who should
slay the same. Ragnar dressed himself in hairy skins, and threw water
over the hair, which, freezing, encased him in an armour of ice. The
Worm, unable to bite through this, was impaled by Ragnar. Another
version is that Ragnar killed two serpents which the King of Gothland
had set to guard his daughter, but which had grown to such size that
they terrified the country. It may be observed that the Lambton story
christianises the Ragnar legend, showing that to be done in atonement
for sin which in the other was done for love. The Cornish legend of St.
Petrox has also taken a hint from Ragnar, and announces the rescue of
christians from the serpent-pit in which the pagan hero perished. The
icicles reappear on the slayer of the dragon of Wantley, represented by
long spikes bristling from his armour.</p>
<p>The Knight Lambton, remembering his vow to slay as a sacrifice the
first living thing he might meet after the combat, had arranged that a
dog should be placed where it would attract his eye. But it turned out
that his own father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415"
name="pb415">415</a>]</span>came rushing to him. As he could not kill
his father, he consulted the oracle again to know what would be the
penalty of non-fulfilment of his vow. It was that no representative of
the family should die in his bed for nine generations. The notion is
still found in that neighbourhood that no Earl of Durham has since then
died in his bed. The nine generations have long passed since any
crusading Lambton lived, but several peasants of the district closed
their narrative with, &lsquo;Strange to say, no Earl of Durham has died
in his bed!&rsquo; At the castle I talked with a servant on the estate
while looking at the old statues of the knight, worm, and dairymaid,
all kept there, and he told me he had heard that the late Earl, as
death drew nigh, asked to sit up&mdash;insisted&mdash;and died in a
chair. If there be any truth in this, it would show that the family
itself has some morbid feeling about the legend which has been so long
told them with pride. The old well from which the little worm emerged a
monster is now much overgrown, but I was told that it was for a long
time a wishing-well, and the pins cast in by rustics may still be seen
at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Pins are the last offerings at the Worm&rsquo;s Well;
&lsquo;wishes&rsquo; its last prayers; but where go now the coins and
the prayers? To propitiate a power and commute a doom resting upon much
the same principles as those represented in the Lambton legend. A
community desolated because one man is sinful miniatures a
world&rsquo;s doom for Adam&rsquo;s sin. The demand of a human
sacrifice is more clear in the Sockburn story, where Conyers offered up
his only son to the Holy Ghost in the parish church before engaging the
Dragon, that being a condition of success prescribed by the
&lsquo;Oracle&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sybil.&rsquo; This claim of the infernal
powers represented by the Worm&mdash;many-eyed, all-seeing&mdash;cannot
be set aside; Lambton&rsquo;s filial love <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb416" href="#pb416" name="pb416">416</a>]</span>may resist it only to
have it pass as the hereditary doom of his family, representing an
imputed sin. &lsquo;For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, and
visit the sins of the fathers on the children unto the third and fourth
generation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are processes of this kind in nature, hereditary evils,
transmitted diseases and disgraces, and afflictions of many through the
offences of one. But a fearful Nemesis follows the deification and
adoration of them. &lsquo;How can I be happy in heaven,&rsquo; said a
tender-hearted lady to her clerical adviser, &lsquo;when I must see
others in hell?&rsquo; &lsquo;You will be made to see that it is all
for the best.&rsquo; &lsquo;If I am to be made so heartless, I prefer
to go to hell.&rsquo; This genuine conversation reports the doom of all
deities whose extension is in dragons. Hell implies a Dragon as its
representative and ruler. Theology may induce the abject and cowardly
to subject their human hearts to the process of induration required for
loyalty to such powers, but in the end it makes atheism the only
salvation of brave, pure, and loving natures. The Dragons&rsquo; breath
has clouded the ancient heavens and blighted the old gods; but the
starry ideals they pursue in vain. Behemoth has supplied sirloins to
many priesthoods for a long time, but he has at last become too tough
even for their teeth, and they feed him less carefully every year. Nay,
he is encountered now and then by his professional feeders, and has
found even in Westminster Abbey his Guy of Warwick.</p>

<p>The Worms&mdash;whether Semitic Leviathan or Aryan Dragon&mdash;are
nearly fossilised as to their ancient form. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span>The
sacrifice of Jephtha&rsquo;s daughter to the one, and of young Conyers
to the other, found commutation in the case of man&rsquo;s rescue from
Satan by Christ&rsquo;s descent to Hades, and in the substitution of
nine uneasy deaths for the demanded parricide in the Lambton case; and
the most direct &lsquo;survival&rsquo; of these may be found in any
country lad trying to cure his warts by providing a weed for them to
adhere to. Their end in Art was in such forms as this starveling
creature of Callot&rsquo;s (<a href="#fig32">Fig. 32</a>), whose thin,
spectacled rider, tilting at St. Anthony, denotes as well the doom of
all powers, however lofty, whose majesty requires <i lang="la">tali
auxilio et istis defensoribus</i>. The Dragon passes and leaves a roar
of laughter behind him, in which even St. Anthony could now join. But
Leviathan and Lambton Worm have combined and merged their life in a
Dogma; it is a Dogma as remorseless and voracious as its prototype, and
requires to be fed with all the milk of human kindness, or it at once
begins to gnaw the foundations of Christendom itself. Christianity
rests upon the past work of the Worm in Paradise, and its present work
in Hell. It makes no real difference whether man&rsquo;s belief in a
universe enmeshed in serpent-coils be expressed in the Hindu&rsquo;s
cowering adoration of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href=
"#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>the venomous potentate, or the
christian&rsquo;s imprecation upon it: fundamentally it is
serpent-worship in each case. Vishnu reposes on his celestial Serpent;
the god of Dogma maintains his government by support of the infernal
Serpent. Fear beheld him appearing in Durham to vindicate the mass and
the Sabbath; but the same fear still sees him in the fiery world
punishing Sabbath-breakers and blasphemers against his Creator and
chief. That fear built every cathedral in Christendom, and they must
crumble with the phantasm evoked for their creation.</p>
<p>The Serpent in itself is a perfect type of all evil in nature. It is
irreconcilable with the reign of a perfectly good and omnipotent man
over the universe. No amount of casuistry can explain its co-existence
with anthropomorphic Love and Wisdom, as all acknowledge when a
parallel casuistry attempts to defend any other god than their own from
deeds that are, humanly considered, evil. It is just as easy to defend
the jealousy and cruelty of Jove, on the ground that his ways are not
as our ways, as it is to defend similar tempers in Jehovah. The monster
sent by one to devour Prometheus is ethically atwin with the snake
created by the other to bite the heel of man.</p>
<p>Man is saved from the superstitious evolution of the venomous
Serpent into a Dragon by recognising its real evolution as seen by the
eye of Science. Science alone can tell the true story of the Serpent,
and justify its place in nature. It forbids man his superstitious
method of making a god in his own image, and his egotistic method of
judging nature according to his private likes and dislikes, his
convenience or inconvenience. Taught by Science man may, with a freedom
the barbarian cannot feel, exterminate the Serpent; with a freedom the
christian cannot know, he may see in that reptile the perfection of
that economy in nature which has ever defended the advancing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=
"pb419">419</a>]</span>forms of life. It judges the good and evil of
every form with reference to its adaptation to its own purposes. Thus
Science alone wields the spear of Ithuriel, and beneath its touch every
Dragon shrinks instantly to its little shape in nature to be dealt with
according to what it is. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href=

<p class="first">Gustave Dor&egrave; has painted a picture of
&lsquo;Love and Fate,&rsquo; in which the terrible hag is portrayed
towering above the tender Eros, and while the latter is extending the
thread as far as he can, the wrinkled hands of Destiny are the
boundaries of his power, and the fatal shears close upon the joy he has
stretched to its inevitable limit. To the ancient mind these two forms
made the two great realms of the universe, their powers meeting in the
fruit with a worm at its core, in seeds of death germinating amid the
play of life, in all the limitations of man. They are projected in
myths of Elysium and Hades, Eden and the Serpent, Heaven and Hell, and
their manifold variants.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no one line of mythological development which more
clearly and impressively illustrates the forces under which grew the
idea of an evil principle, than the changes which the personification
of Fate underwent in Greece and Rome. The Moira, or Fate with Homer, is
only a secondary cause, if that, and simply carries out the decrees of
her father, Zeus. Zeus is the real Fate. Nevertheless, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>while this is the Homeric theory or theology,
there are intimations (see chap. xxvii. part 4) that the real awe of
men was already transferred from Zeus to the Erinnyes. This foreshadows
a change of government. With Hesiod we find, instead of one, three
Moir&aelig;. They are no longer offspring of Zeus, but, as it were, his
Cabinet. They do not act independently of him, but when, in pursuance
of their just counsels, Zeus issues decrees, the Moir&aelig; administer
them. Next we find the Moir&aelig; of Hesiod developed by other writers
into final Recorders; they write the decrees of Zeus on certain
indestructible tablets, after which they are irrevocable and
inevitable. With &AElig;schylus we find the Moir&aelig; developed into
independent and supreme powers, above Zeus himself. The chained
Prometheus looks not to Zeus but to Fate for his final liberation.</p>

</div>
<p class="first">These great landmarks represent successive revolutions
in the Olympian government. Absolutism became burthensome: as
irresponsible monarch, Zeus became responsible for the woes of the
world, and his priests were satisfied to have an increasing share of
that responsibility allotted to his counsellors, until finally the
whole of it is transferred. From that time the countenance of Zeus, or
Jupiter, shines out unclouded by responsibility for human misfortunes
and earthly evils; and, on the other hand, the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name="pb422">422</a>]</span>once
beautiful Fates are proportionately blackened, and they become hideous
hags, the aged and lame crones of popular belief in Greece and Rome,
every line of whose ugliness would have disfigured the face of Zeus had
he not been subordinated to them.</p>
<p>Moira means &lsquo;share,&rsquo; and originally, perhaps, meant
simply the power that meted out to each his share of life, and of the
pains and pleasures woven in it till the term be reached. But as the
Fates gained more definite personality they began to be regarded as
having also a &lsquo;share&rsquo; of their own. They came to typify all
the dark and formidable powers as to their inevitableness. No divine
power could set them aside, or more than temporarily subdue them. Fate
measured out her share to the remorseless Gorgon as well as to the
fairest god. But where destructive power was exercised in a way
friendly to man, the Fates are put somewhat in the background, and the
feat is claimed for some god. Such, in the &lsquo;Prometheus&rsquo; of
&AElig;schylus, is the spirit of the wonderful passage concerning
Typhon, rendered with tragic depth by Theodore Buckley:&mdash;&lsquo;I
commiserated too,&rsquo; says the rock-bound Prometheus, &lsquo;when I
beheld the earth-born inmate of the Cilician caverns, a tremendous
prodigy, the hundred-headed impetuous Typhon, overpowered by force; who
withstood all the gods, hissing slaughter from his hungry jaws, and
from his eyes there flashed a hideous glare as if he would perforce
overthrow the sovereignty of Jove. But the sleepless shaft of Jupiter
came upon him, the descending thunderbolt breathing forth flame which
scared him out of his presumptuous bravadoes; for having been smitten
to his very soul he was crumbled to a cinder, and thunder-blasted in
his prowess. And now, a hapless and paralysed form, is he lying hard by
a narrow frith, pressed down beneath the roots of &AElig;tna. And,
seated on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span>topmost peaks, Vulcan forges the molten masses
whence there shall burst forth floods, devouring with full jaws the
level fields of fruitful Sicily; with rage such as this shall Typhon
boil over in hot artillery of a never glutted fire-breathing storm;
albeit he hath been reduced to ashes by the thunderbolt of
Jupiter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this passage we see Jove invested with the glory of defeating a
great demon; but we also recognise the demon still under the protection
of Fate. Destiny must bear that burthen. So was it said in the
Apocalypse Satan should be loosed after being bound in the Pit a
thousand years; and so Mohammed declared Gog and Magog should break
loose with terror and destruction from the mountain-prison in which
Allah had cast them. The destructive Principle had its
&lsquo;share&rsquo; as well as the creative and preservative
Principles, and could not be permanently deprived of it. Gradually the
Fates of various regions and names were identified with the deities,
whose interests, gardens, or treasures they guarded; and when some of
these deities were degraded their retainers were still more degraded,
while in other cases deities were enabled to maintain fair fame by
fables of their being betrayed and their good intentions frustrated by
such subordinates. Thus we find a certain notion of technical and
official power investing such figures as Satan, Ahriman, Iblis, and the
Dragon, as if the upper gods could not disown or reverse altogether the
bad deeds done by these commissioners.</p>
<p>But the large though limited degree of control necessarily claimed
for the greatest and best gods had to be represented theologically.
Hence there was devised a system of Commutation. The Demon or Dragon,
though abusing his power, could not have it violently withdrawn, but
might be compelled to accept some sacrifice in lieu of the precise
object sought by his voracity. These substitutions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>are
found in every theological system, and to apply them to individuals
constitutes the <i lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of every
priesthood. In the progress towards civilisation the substitutes
diminish in value, and finally they become merely nominal and
ceremonial,&mdash;an effigy of a man instead of the man, or wine
instead of blood. At first the commutation was often in the
substitution of persons of lower for others of higher rank, as when
slaves or wives were, or are, sacrificed to assure paradise to the
master or husband. Thus, Death is allowed to take Alcestis instead of
Admetus. A higher degree of civilisation substitutes animals for human
victims. In keeping with this is the legend of Christ&rsquo;s sending
demons out of two men into a herd of swine:<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7246src" href="#xd26e7246" name="xd26e7246src">1</a> which,
again, is referable to the same class of ideas as the legend that
followed concerning Jesus himself as a vicarious offering; mankind in
this case being the herd, as compared with the son of a god, and the
transfer of the Satanic power from the human race to himself, for even
a little time, being accepted in theology as an equivalent, on account
of the divine dignity of the being who descended into hell. It was some
time, however, before theology worked out this theory as it now stands,
the candid fathers having rejoiced in the belief that the contract for
commutation on its face implied that Christ was to remain for ever in
hell, Satan being outwitted in this.</p>
<p>The ancient Babylonian charms often end with the
refrain:&mdash;&lsquo;May the enchantment go forth and to its own
dwelling-place betake itself,&rsquo; Every evil spirit was supposed to
have an appropriate dwelling, as in the case of Judas, into whom Satan
entered,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7253src" href="#xd26e7253" name=
"xd26e7253src">2</a> and of whom it is said he &lsquo;by transgression
fell, that he might go to his own place.<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7258" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7260src" href="#xd26e7260" name="xd26e7260src">3</a> Very
ingenious are some of the ancient speculations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>concerning the habitations and congenial resorts
of demons. In some regions the colour of a disease on the skin is
supposed to indicate the tastes of the demon causing it; and the spells
of exorcism end by assigning him to something of the same hue. The
demon of jaundice is generally consigned to the yellow parrots, and
inflammation to the red or scarlet weeds. Their colours are respected.
Humanity is little considered in the Eastern formulas of this kind, and
it is pretty generally the case that in praying against plague or
famine, populations are often found selecting a tribe to which their
trouble is adjured to betake itself. &lsquo;May Nin-cigal,&rsquo; says
a Babylonian exorcism, &lsquo;turn her face towards another place; may
the noxious spirit go forth and seize another; may the female cherub
and the female demon settle upon his body; may the king of heaven
preserve, may the king of earth preserve!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So is it in regions and times which we generally think of as
semi-barbarous. But every now and then communities which fancy
themselves civilised and enlightened are brought face to face with the
popular fatalism in its pagan form, and are shocked thereat, not
remembering that it is equally the dogma of vicarious satisfaction or
atonement. A lady residing in the neighbourhood of the Traunsee,
Austria, informs me that recently two men were nearly drowned in that
lake, being rescued at the last moment and brought to life with great
difficulty. But this incident, instead of causing joy among the
neighbours of the men, excited their displeasure; and this not because
the rescued were at all unpopular, but because of a widespread notion
that the Destinies required two lives, that they would have to be
presently satisfied with two others, and that since the agonies of the
drowning men had passed into unconsciousness, it would have been better
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426</a>]</span>surrender the selected victims to their fate. At
Elsinore, in Denmark, when the sea moans it is said to &lsquo;want
somebody,&rsquo; and it is generally the case that some story of a
person just drowned circulates afterwards.</p>
<p>While the early mythological forms of the Fates diminish and pass
away as curious superstitions, they return in metaphysical disguises.
They gather their kindred in primitive sciences and cosmogonies, and
finding their old home swept free of pagan demons, and, garnished with
philosophic phrases, they enter as grave theories; but their subtlety
and their sting is with them, and the last state of the house they
occupy is worse than the first.</p>
<p>Yes, worse: for all that man ever won of courage or moral freedom,
by conquering his dragons in detail, he surrenders again to the
phantom-forces they typified when he gives up his mind to belief in a
power not himself that makes for evil. The terrible conclusion that
Evil is a positive and imperishable Principle in the universe carries
in it the poisonous breath of every Dragon. It lurks in all theology
which represents the universe as an arena of struggle between good and
evil Principles, and human life as a war of the soul against the flesh.
It animates all the pious horrors which identify Materialism with
wickedness. It nestles in the mind which imagines a personal deity
opposed by any part of nature. It coils around every heart which adores
absolute sovereign Will, however apotheosised.</p>
<p>All of these notions, most of all belief in a supreme arbitrary
Will, are modern disguises of Fate; and belief in Fate is the one thing
fatal to human culture and energy. The notion of Fate (<i>fatum</i>,
the word spoken) carries in it the conception of arbitrariness in the
universe, of power deliberately exerted without necessary reference to
the nature of things; and it is precisely opposed to that idea
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href="#pb427" name=
"pb427">427</a>]</span>of Necessity taught by Science, which is another
name for the supremacy of Law. Happily the notion of a universe held at
the mercy of a personal decree is suicidal in a world full of sorrows
and agonies, which, on such a theory, can only be traced to some
individual caprice or malevolence. However long abject fear may silence
the lips of the suffering, rebellion is in their hearts. Every blow
inflicted, directly or permissively, by mere Will, however omnipotent,
every agony that is consciously detached from universal organic
necessity, in order that it may be called &lsquo;providential,&rsquo;
can arouse no natural feeling in man nobler than indignation. The
feeling of a suitor in a court of law, who knows that the adverse
judgment that ruins him has no root in the facts or the law, but
proceeds from the prejudice or whim of the judge, can be nowise
different from that of a mother who sees her son stricken down by
death, and hears at his grave that he was consumed by the wrath of a
god who might have yielded to her prayer, but refused it. The
heart&rsquo;s protest may be throttled for a time by the lingering coil
of terror, but it is there, and christian theologians will be as
anxious to protect their deity from it, at whatever cost to his
sovereignty, as their predecessors who invented the Cabinet of Women to
relieve Jove from responsibility.</p>
<p>Metaphysics&mdash;which appear to have developed into the art of
making things look true in words when their untruth in fact has been
detected&mdash;have indeed already set about the task just predicted.
Eminent divines are found writing about matter and spirit, freedom and
natural law, as solemnly as if all this discussion were new, and had
never been carried out to its inevitable results. They can only put in
christian or modern phraseology conclusions which have been reached
again and again in the history of human speculation. The various
schools <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>of Buddhist and Vedantist philosophy have come
by every conceivable route to their fundamental unity of belief in God,
Soul, and Matter; in a pessimist visible nature, an ideal invisible
nature, and a human soul held in matter like a frog in a snake&rsquo;s
mouth, but able by certain mysterious, mostly metaphysical or verbal,
tactics, to gain release, and pass into a corresponding situation in
the deity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a king, whose son had strayed away from him and lived in
ignorance of his father among the Veddahs (wild men), will, on
discovering his son, exclaim, &lsquo;Come to me, my darling son!&rsquo;
and make him a participator of the happiness he himself enjoys, even so
will the Supreme God present himself before the soul when in
distress&mdash;the soul enmeshed in the net of the five Veddahs
(senses), and, severing that soul from P&acirc;sam (Matter), assimilate
it to himself, and bless it at his holy feet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is too late for man to be interested in an
&lsquo;omnipotent&rsquo; Personality, whose power is mysteriously
limited at the precise point when it is needed, and whose moral
government is another name for man&rsquo;s own control of nature.
Nevertheless, this Oriental pessimism is the Pauline theory of Matter,
and it is the speculative protoplasm out of which has been evolved, in
many shapes, that personification which remains for our
consideration&mdash;the Devil.</p>
